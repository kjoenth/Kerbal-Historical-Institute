ChangeLog:

=================================== v1.0.5 ============================================================

Hotfixed (build 1028+):
* Reduced engine heating: less explosive decoupling.
* Fixed NRE on Kerbal when the part it's on dies.
* Fixed IVA breaking on crew transfer.
* Fixed typo on Dynawing craft.
* IntakeAir resource is now fully hidden in Resources App.
* Fixed body lift (it now exists again).
* Fixed every instance of part name, so root parts can be detected in all contractual instances.
* Used Unity drag to avoid integration errors on splashdown.
* Clamped parachute radiation.
* Upgrade outdated instances of vessel situations in career saves
* Included layer 19 objects in potential enclosing colliders for cargo bays

Parts:
* Added 'Juno' 0.625m jet engine
* Added 0.625m air intake
* Added 0.625m Liquid Fuel tank
* Added 'Panther' afterburning jet engine
* Added 'Goliath' giant turbofan engine
* Added S3 KS-25-1 'Vector' Rocket engine, with super-large gimballing range
* Added Mk3 size Cargo Ramp
* Added Mk3 engine mount piece
* Added Mk1 crew cabin, seats two
* Added new Mini-ISRU part
* Mk1 Cockpit model overhauled
* Mk1 Cockpit IVA space overhauled
* XM-G50 Air intake model overhauled
* Mk1 Fuel, Structural and Intake Fuselage parts overhauled
* T1 Toroidal Aerospike engine model overhauled
* J-33 'Wheesley' Jet engine model overhauled
* J-X4 'Whiplash' Jet engine model overhauled
* Engine Nacelle and Engine Precooler parts overhauled

Contracts:
* Added Station and Base Contextual Contracts, requiring you to modify/expand existing bases and stations
* Added Satellite Contextual Contracts, requiring maintenance operations to previously deployed satellites
* Added Survey Contextual Contracts, which target existing landed vessels to request (applicable) survey missions of them
* Part Test contract generation logic has been modified. Each part now has a much more specific set of constraints before it generates, to give it much more consistent and realistic altitudes, speeds, and envelopes.
* Passive Progress Rewards: gives a light reward automatically to any new achievement. These are given independently of accepted World-Firsts Contracts, but are not as substantial.
* Contract Decline Penalty: A small reputation penalty is incurred when a contract is declined, to prevent Mission Control from being abused as a slot machine.
* New early game part haul contracts - easier part tests that only require you to bring the payload to a designated location.
* Early game focused surveys balanced to be much more forgiving.
* New part tests added for fairings and heat shields.
* Many milestones added that involve the player doing hidden fun stuff.

Strategies:
* Added Leadership Initiative Strategy: increases passive rewards for achievements, at the cost of reduced contract rewards. Useful to boost self-driven playstyles.

Progress Tracking:
* Added new World First contract types for space walking, crew transfers, and flight on atmospheric planets.
* There is also now a fourth record "track" for oceanic depth.
* Many progress nodes now track progress in separate manned and unmanned tracks. This allows several contracts to appear at more relevant times.
* Base and Station, plant flag, kerbal recoveries (rescues), crewed surveys, tourism, and some World Firsts contracts now require manned progress.
* Satellite contracts now require unmanned progress.
* The algorithm to choose planets for all contracts is now more reliable. Max CB "distance" has been reduced to two. This means you will no longer see contracts for Duna and Eve right after taking off from Kerbin.

Science and Comms:
* Science Transmission messages now show strategy changes to science, funds, and reputation.
* All antennae now cut a transmission that has been interrupted due to power loss to prevent severely devaluing the resulting science.
* Added an option to antenna context menus to manually enable partial transmissions.
* Interrupted transmissions no longer delete science data. The data will attempt to return to the container it came from.
* Transmission from orbital surveyors and science labs was tweaked slightly to look and behave more like standard science transmissions.

NavBall:
* The navball is now available on EVA to assist in surveys.
* The EVA NavBall follows the orientation of the camera, rather than that of the Kerbal. This allows looking around to get your bearings.
* The navball throttle and RCS lights are hooked up to the EVA jetpack. 
* The IVA navball now functions with survey navigation.
* Survey navigation icon will now automatically target the next/closest adjacent waypoint in a survey upon completion of a targeted waypoint

Thermodynamics:
* Introduced the concept of 'Core Heat'. Allowing part systems to work much more expressively with temperatures, reducing unwanted cross-talk between temp effects on internal logic and heat transfer to other parts.
* Radiators should have a significant impact on core heat, allowing ISRU modules to operate at peak efficiency.
* Incredibly hot cores should bleed off some of their heat to the parent part, with the vessel very slowly getting warmer over time. 
* Parts should not explode from core overheating, but ISRU modules may shut down.
* Thermal efficiency should be consistent across all warp levels - no cheating!
* The mini-ISRU is balanced in that it cannot operate indefinitely. It will eventually shut down due to overheat and have to be allowed a cool-off period.
* The RTG is also part of this mechanic, making it a viable heater (Kerbals have the added advantage of not requiring any potatoes for unplanned long-duration stays on desolate planets).
* Fixed thermodynamics issues from 1.0.4 regarding unclamped conduction, shielded conduction, and other runaway cases.
* Reworked upper atmospheres of planets for better aerocapture experience. Added convection and shockwave temperature multipliers per body.
* EVA kerbals handled properly.
* Lowered max internal temperatures of crewed parts.
* Heating from engine exhaust rebalanced.
* Thermo at high warp is now no longer instantaneous, and is moddable via new interfaces.
* Unloaded vessels will have thermo applied for the unloaded time on reload.

Buoyancy and Water:
* Displacement is now calculated per part using dragcube information to estimate total actual volume of the part. 
* Bodies now have an ocean density: Kerbin/Laythe is 1 tonne/m^3, Eve is 1.5.
* The lowest and highest points of parts are calculated with respect to the water, and a submerged fraction of volume is calculated to modify buoyancy force.
* Impact speed (tested against crashTolerance) depends on impact angle, with a configurable minimum multiplier.
* Drag in water uses drag cubes and an accurate dynamic pressure calculation.
* Drag scales from high on first vessel contact down to a lower value after a few seconds.
* Drag also ramps back up when the vessel is below a minimum velocity (to model the highly turbulent flow when starting from a stop, and to make sure vessels do come to a stop).
* Lift behaves similarly, starting near zero for the madly turbulent flow of initial contact or first movement, up to a reasonable value.
* Various hollow parts have their displacement tuned to account for hollowness.
* Solar panels lose flow rate underwater, rocket engines lose Isp.
* Added underwater fog and tint, fixed camera issues underwater.

Physics:
* PhysicsGlobals now properly create the default values when Physics.cfg is removed. It includes many new values.
* Drag coefficient changes based on the same factors as turbulent convection (a Pseudo-Reynolds number). This means higher drag high up in the atmosphere, and slightly lower drag when going very fast very low.
* Asteroids have correct drag cubes now.
* Fixed issue with radiator dragcubes being incorrect when the panels rotate.
* Add missing drag cube overrides for hollow parts.
* Kerbal EVA drag cube can now be specified in Physics.cfg.
* Fix issues with override drag cubes and root parts during revert/quickload/vessel switch.
* Fixed issues with female kerbal ragdoll rigidbodies.
* Fixed a bug in calculating how solar flux diminishes in atmosphere.
* Jettisoned Fairing panels now exist in a new layer (L19) dedicated to non-part physical objects.
* Contact with L19 objects does not cause vessels to shift into 'landed' state.
* Kerbals are allowed to stand on L19 objects, regardless of their own landed state (similar to how they behave when on ladders).
* Contact with L19 objects only allows Kerbals to stand and walk while within a surface-level altitude/speed envelope. (contact with these objects in orbit has the same effect as bumping into anything else).
* Eve and Jool had upper atmosphere changes to thin the top band. Duna now shares the molar mass of Eve but has a lower presure than before, leading to the same density (and drag) at sea level but better physical characteristics.

Misc:
* Fix surface horizontal velocity being incorrectly calculated.
* Launch clamps are now properly kept at the launch pad, they will not follow the current vessel.
* Fix an issue with localisation and settings.cfg. Fix an issue with plugging/unplugging controllers breaking/losing settings.
* Save and load kerbal trait in save games, trait is generated from name hash only if not specified in the save.
* Fix issue with solar day length not being calculated correctly when setting Kerbin's rotational period.
* Workaround for kerbals becoming debris added, to prevent serious issues.
* Sped up finding a given AvailablePart (especially relevant when populating the Load Craft menu).
* Sped up craft loading slightly.
* Sped up FlightIntegrator and in particular the Occlusion part.
* Fix some bugs in resource requests that would lower throttle or miss resources. Optimized resource calls. 
* Jets now use a fuel mode that draws an equal percentage from all reachable parts (no-crossfeed parts will block crossfeed).
* Fixed an issue with camera pitch underwater.
* Fixed an issue with error spam from failed raycasts when >600m under water.
* Fix an issue with fast EVAing kerbals leading to NaNs.
* Fix an issue with compound parts and zero look rotation vector logspam, also slight speedup.
* Optimized several contract/progress parameters to not require any code running in update-loops (they're event-driven now)
* Fixed orientation of the sun light in IVA
* All older careers will have their contracts upgraded to new versions, maintaining compatibility.
* Many new career cheats added.
* Contracts.cfg now fully comments itself.

Editor:
* Fix an issue where non-root parts spawned in the editor did not have their partInfo set correctly.
* Fix an issue where symmetry mode could be increased past its limits.

Part Class and Modules:
* Fixed some issues in RCS, made RCS toggleable in the editor and gave it a thrust percentage slider.
* Solar panels and radiators: fixed curve issue with solar panel efficiency where when at high temperatures the generated EC could go negative.
* Solar panels and radiators now use dynamic pressure instead of (linear) velocity when calculating breakage.
* Fix Solar panels and radiators to support sun tracking drag cube changes even if no extend/retract animation is specified, add support for an offset angle when tracking the sun.
* Solar panels can now extend and retract in the editor. 
* Solar panels now respect aero shielding regarding EC generation.
* Parachutes: fixed exception spam in parachute module in the editor, fix where parachutes would cut on decouple. 
* Parachutes now have a disarm option when armed and not yet deployed
* Parachute stack icon background shows red when unsafe and yellow when risky.
* Parachutes no longer flutter identically.
* Parachutes no longer instantly snap to the velocity vector.
* Parachute tooltip in the editor shows safe deployment speed near sea level on Kerbin.
* Allow alternators and FXAnimateThrottle to be bound to MultiModeEngine, to an indexed engine module, or to a named engine module. 
* Fix some issues in ModuleAlternator, add support for a threshold below which no resource will be pushed/pulled. 
* FXAnimateThrottle can now optionally depend on engine output or engine currentThrottle, not on the vessel/UI throttle state. Can also modify anim speed rather than time.
* Added support for layers to ModuleAnimateGeneric, ModuleAnimateHeat, and FXModuleAnimateThrottle.
* FXModuleAnimateThrottle can now weight its animation based on wether the engine is active or not (used with multimode engines).
* Allow MultiMode engines to share throttle state when switching and to have automatic switching be disabled (and the toggle for it not show up).
* Made ModuleAnimateHeat more tunable due to new thermo.
* Docking ports now have gendered as an option, and support limited docking angles.
* Docking ports crossfeed state is now persistent and can be toggled in the editor and by action group. 
* Docking ports can have their 'decouple' mode set to stageable. 
* Docking ports node type field supports comma-delimited lists of valid types. 
* Fix an issue with shielded docking port orientation causing logspam in the editor.
* Various Claw bugs that could break games are fixed.
* Fix Airbrake action group persistence.
* Give airbrakes the same thermal tolerance as other airliner parts.
* Fix issue where the airbrake had no orientation vector set, thus resulting in continues "Look rotation vector is zero" messages when trying to attach in the editor.
* Lower some out-of-norm crash tolerances for aero parts.
* Ladders now properly have multiple drag cubes (due to their animations).
* Fixed ladder extend/retract failing after a load in the editor.
* Shrouds no longer glow on revert and can be set to only detach when the node opens, not just when the part is activated by staging.
* Shrouds can be toggled off in the editor.
* Control surfaces deploy state is now properly persistent.
* Offset cargo bay interior nodes so the inside and outside nodes do not precisely overlap, to aid in part placement.
* Procedural fairings set part mass in the editor as well as in flight, properly offset CoL, CoP, CoM depending on fairing state, properly reset drag cube after deploying.
* Fixed issues with intake logic and display airspeed. Intakes can now have mach curves which can affect their efficiency at different mach numbers.
* IntakeAir is no longer displayed, since it was confusing, instead engines show whether their current requirements are being met.
* Engine modules support new curves for modify Isp based on air density and current mach number, so multFlow no longer exists as a toggle.
* Fixed an issue where throttle was not reset to zero on flameout. 
* Engine modules now show percentage of their current propellant requirements being met. 
* Fix flow cap not being used in tooltip info.
* Corrected an issue with the 'fuel flow' display.
* ModuleAnimateGeneric events and action can be independently enabled/disabled per scene.
* Make hatch obstruction check distance tunable per part.
* Allow no-activation-when-shielded to be toggleable in cfg for engines and RCS.
* Fix bandwidth calculation typo for ModuleDataTransmitter.
* Activate gimbals when an engine activates, not only when an engine activates from staging the part.
* Fix Brake Torque tweakable on wheels to have fuller range, allow adjusting stiffness in cfg.
* Fix flow cap not being set in jet engine cfgs.
* Intakes and engines can be set in their MODULE config to be disabled when under water (disableUnderwater).
* Decouplers can have their staging and their crossfeed toggleable.
* Fixed several edge cases where CargoBays would not update the shielded status of contained parts correctly.
* Connected cargo bays now propagate any state updates to all bays in the connected space, ensuring all bays refresh when any of them does.

UI:
* Units have been added to various part tooltips and Thermal Data, and the part tooltip has more and better information shown.
* Thermal Data shows when skin temp shown is the exposed temperature only or the unified skin temperature. 
* Heatshields now show data when Thermal Data is enabled.
* Fixed temperature gauges bug where it was using internal max temperature, not skin max temperature, despite comparing that against the current skin temperature.
* Made edge highlight separately toggleable from the gauges.
* The settings menu now shows the various settings, and F10 toggles through all four possible arrangements.
* Flags no longer count as active flights on the Resume Game interface in the Main Menu.
* Fix issues with FlightLogger's values not accounting for reference shifts.
* If a part on a vessel is targeted, display the vessel label over the part, not the center of the vessel.
* Fix Center of Thrust marker in the editor (was not properly calculating direction).
* Fix an issue where loading a save via the Load Save menu would not properly clear, nor load, AppLauncher messages.
* Fix an issue where an unreadable agent texture would break agent loading (and contracts generally).
* Made crew transfer available from the part right-click menu.
* Made 'rename vessel' available in flight for a vessel whether or not it is under command (though a ModuleCommand still must be present for renaming in the flight scene).
* Fix issues where partname not part title was used.
* Fix vector to target (on navball) to calculate from current control-from-here transform to target transform, rather than vessel root transform to target transform.
* Fix an issue where a tweakable being open might spam OnVesselModified events in the editor. This also lowers memory leaks.

Input:
* Double-tapping RMB now enables a mouselook-toggle mode, similar to RMB behaviour in IVA views.
* Added independent key binding [backslash] for mouselook toggle
* Mouselook mode can be cancelled by double-tapping LMB, MMB, or by tapping RMB or Esc.
* Mouselook mode will also self-cancel on any scene changes, but persists through camera mode changes, for uninterrupted panning through multiple view modes.
* Tapping ModKey no longer releases mouselook in IVA.

Graphics:
* AeroFX now tuned better (and more tunable), leading to mach effects down low without flaming rockets at mid-altitude.
* The glow parts make when they heat too much (not the same as the highlighting they get when near maximum temperature) has been tuned.
* Fix issues with flags resetting to default, flags never changing for first two Pad tiers.
* Fix Val's missing visor in the main menu scene.
* Add RenderType to some PQS and Scaled shaders to aid in visual modding.
* Allow eye position offsets specified for seats in IVA, both for normal view and for the portrait view (different variables).
* Allow IVA and IVA-kerbal rescaling.
* Credits scene now has column bars on screen aspects wider than 16:9 (clamping max aspect ratio to 16:9)

Modding Support:
* Support having KSPEvents available even when the vessel is not under command (defaults to false, can be set true for an event).
* Fix an issue with VesselModule / PartModule instantiation order differing for fresh and loaded vessels. 
* Fix an issue where VesselModule order could not be set, they now can override GetOrder, by which all VesselModules are sorted. 
* VesselModules default to order = 999 but FlightIntegrator has order 0 (this will allow easy setting of some modules to run before FlightIntegrator and some afterwards, 0 is a good delimeter).
* GameVariables are now aware whether they are called from the rocket (VAB/Pad) or spaceplane (SPH/runway) side.
* Catch errors during ScenarioModule and Contract loading, preventing breakage when mods throw exceptions during these times.
* Fix an issue in assembly dependency version checking.
* Added a new interface IActivateOnDecouple that will call the stated method when the part decouples on the stated node.
* ConfigNodes/values support comments (which will be serialized on write).
* Add fallback tech tree URL in case the main URL fails to find a valid tech tree.
* PartModules can toggle their part being in the staging list or not. 
* Decouplers (and docking ports, but it defaults unstaged) have it on by default. This is part of the base PartModule so all that is needed to implement is add some settings to the MODULE.
* Resources now have an isVisible flag, which determines whether the resource is visible on the right-click menu. Applied it (as false) to IntakeAir.
* KerbalEVA now uses the rotPower member.
* Fix enum parsing in BaseFields (i.e. KSPFields). It should now work.
* Support tagging models with Drag_Hidden (like Icon_Hidden) so they will not be rendered when rendering drag cubes.
* Added OnFlightUIModeChanged event, fired from FlightUIModeManager. (notifies of changing between Staging, Docking and Map modes in flight)
* High-warp (analytic) thermo supports three interfaces, IAnalyticTemperatureModifier, IAnalyticPreview, and IAnalyticOverheatModule for better customization, and uses new fields in Part for tuning.

=================================== v1.0.4 ============================================================

Bug Fixes:

* Hot-Fixed an issue where loading vessels equipped with heatshields from pre-1.0.3 saves would cause the game to crash.


=================================== v1.0.3 ============================================================

New:

Parts:
* Added five new Radiator parts, three of which are deployable.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

Misc:
* Fixed a bug where using the reset button with an Asteroid loaded would break the Mun tutorial.
* Made part's internal highlighter much more efficient.
* Disabled flashing highlighter in temperature gauges. (fixes memory leak with temperature overlay)
* Fixed KSPUtil.PrintLatitude/Longitude giving wrong result for small negative values.
* Fix for horizontalSrfSpd being incorrectly calculated.
* Fixed unfortunate typo in the Docking Tutorial.
* Fixed an issue where moving the camera using a 3D mouse would break drag-and-dropping of parts in the editors.

Thermal:
* 1.0.3 features a revised thermal mechanic to better balance heating/cooling between pods and spaceplanes.
* Parts now have separate internal temperature and skin temperatures. 
* Skin temperature is the temperature used for radiation and convection, as well as engine exhaust damage. 
* Part internal temperature is increased by modules that generate heat and is used for part-part conduction. 
* Part internal and skin temperature also conduct between each other.
* Solar panel efficiency is now calculated based on skin temperature.
* When in an atmosphere, there is a divide between the exposed (to convection) and unexposed skin temperatures.
* When not in an atmosphere, only one skin temperature is tracked; the two temperatures are unified on atmosphere exit.
* Radiative outflux and influx is tracked separately for exposed and unexposed areas of skin (since the shock temperature is much higher than ambient temperature).

Physics:
* Added curve to control drag coefficient exponent to DCL and Physics.cs
* With lowered drag for sharply-tapered cubes, wing lift and wing drag lowered to match.
* Convection velocity exponent raised to 3.3 to increase reentry heat, as well as convection factor.
* Convection min area typo corrected.
* Newtonian convection kept pace with hypersonic convection.
* Drag curves modified to lower transonic hump.
* Wing curves modified to lower change in drag based on deflection.
* Calculation of exposed area for convection fixed, spaceplanes no longer get as extreme heat.
* Flight integrator: allow setting of newtonian density exponent (default 0.5) and use density or density^exponent whichever is greater.
* Broke radiation into two parts, you get the regular background temp on your face not exposed to reentry flux, and the very high reentry one for the area that is.
* Clamped convection correctly so you will never pass external temperature.
* Added a factor to simulate the switch from laminar to turbulent flow (in layman's terms, if you're going too fast too low, you get a massive boost to heating). That corrects so steep reentries are in fact deadlier than shallow ones.
* Added conduction-changer module to Mk1 and Mk1-2 pods (necessary to not kill chutes), buffed heat shields for new heat loads. Changed burn/rip numbers for drogue chutes.
* Parachute module updated to use the new convection code.
* Skin temperature variables are controllable on per-part basis.
* Sped up Flight Integrator slightly by minimizing repeated loops through parts.
* Better compute various vessel values This should lower phantom orbit changing and wobble!
* Remove thermal mass as a factor in conduction rate: what matters is area.
* Add conduction between parts' skins (as well as between the internals of parts, between a part's internals and its skin, and between the exposed and unexposed skin of a part, all of which were already in.)
* Fix some small issues in conduction (better clamping), sped it up slightly.
* Fixed issue with radiation (no longer have to use dirty hack to prevent parts blowing up).
* Lowered skin thickness slightly globally, made magic number sane (part.skinMassPerArea is now in kg/m^2).
* Added Hsp (resource thermal mass value) to Ore resource.

Parts:
* Updated Mk1 Inline Cockpit model.
* Further decrease in LV-N heat production.
* Rebalance of SRB for the new drag changes.
* KR-2L description updated, mass to 9t, SL Isp to 255.
* Jet thrusts rebalanced for new drag (thrusts lowered, BJE curves altered). Jet Isp halved due to increased fuel quantity and lower drag.
* Lowered LV-N heat a bit, still a bit hot.
* Edited KS-25x4 "Mammoth" engine description.
* Update description of radial-mount engines to recommend use for extra attitude control.
* Mk1 fuel tank: uses same dry mass fraction and resource filling compared to its LFO counterpart as Mk2 parts do.
* Radial attachment point cost lowered.
* Shielded docking port radial attach node fixed.
* Aerospike mass lowered as a buff (it needed a buff to compete with late-tier engines) and tangents fixed.
* Heat shield thermal mass modifier increased to 0.05 to deal with increased heating. Max temp lowered to 3000 to avoid totally overpowered radiation heatloss.
* Mk3 cargo bays have override cubes (they got missed when cargo bays got custom cubes) - should now have expected drag.
* New large landing gear have override cubes (cubes were reversed).
* Mk3 parts have breaking forces/torques specified and should no longer break on landing.
* Mk2 cockpits have same breaking force/torque as other Mk2 parts.
* Ablator resource heat capacity increased.
* Rebalanced LV-1 to have Sea Level ISP of 80.
* Rebalanced Poodle to have Sea Level ISP of 90.
* To fix spaceplane vs pod reentry and better allow hot reentries, temp is separated between part internal temperature and part skin temperature.
* Fixed some occlusion issues. Occlusion is now over-generous rather than under-generous.
* Buffed heat resistance of spaceplane parts.

* Fixed Radian vs Lat/Lon bug in Overlay and made displays more consistent.
* Fixed potential exploits with sci lab.
* Removed transparency and added direct-attach node to heat shields.
* Balanced heat shields for skin temps. A Mk1-2 straight-in reentry to Eve starting at 6.5km/sec surface (more orbital) is just barely survivable (ablator fully depletes), and regular Eve and Kerbin Munar reentries deplete about 1/6 to 1/4 the shield.
* Added a tuning factor to conduction between parts with different shielded states, so a cargo/service bay won't conduct much to parts within it. Since radiation is disabled for parts within bays, they'd just increase in temperature with no way to cool during reentry, and parts in bays would be the first to blow up on reentry.
* Upped non-drogue chute default full-deploy altitude since pods were crashing before the chute fully opened.
* Upped non-drogue chutes' stress/thermal limits for deployment (safe speed is now around 290m/s at sea level rather than 250). Increased the time to fully deploy slightly so less of a G shock.
* Increased max temp of linear RCS, slightly decreased max temp of RCS quad.
* Tweaks to fairings to change the skin:internal thermal mass distribution, and better protect parts inside fairings and cargo bays.
* Not-Rockomax Micronode side stack nodes corrected.
* Parachutes now have deployment warnings in the Part Action menu, when it's safe to deploy etc.
* Halved intakeAir requirements for jets. Slightly raises service ceiling, mainly helps mitigate flameouts due to resource transfer issues.
* Balanced thermal mass of drogue chutes to correct max opening velocities.
* Attach node refinements on Wing Connector Type A and Structural Wing Type A.
* Removed drag from Intake context UI.

Modding API:
* flow multiplier curves can multiply thrust rather than flow.

* Space Program Department Reps: Meet Mortimer Kerman, your Finances guy, Linus Kerman, Science rep and Wernher's intern (because Wernher is too important to be bothered with these meetings) and Walt Kerman, PR representative who takes his job very literally sometimes, and Gus Kerman, head of Operations, who hopefully cleaned his boots before showing up this time.
* Strategies are of course, completely mod-friendly, and defined through cfg. So are the departments, in fact.

Crew Transfer:
* Kerbals in the same vessel don't need a spacesuit anymore to switch seats. Just click the crew hatch and select Transfer to tell them to go sit somewhere else.

Spaceplane Parts Overhaul:

* Obsolete spaceplane parts replaced by new ones when applicable. (Delta wing, Structural wind, Wing Connector, Mk2 fuselages)


KSC Vessel Markers:
* You can now see (and focus/recover) vessels landed near the Space Center directly from the Space Center scene. Markers will show their positions and expand to show extra information when clicked.

NavBall Vectors:
* The Navball now shows all 6 vectors when in Orbit mode: Progade, Retrograde, Radial In/Out, Normal and Antinormal.
* Off-screen maneuver vectors now have an arrow which points towards them so they're easier to find.

New:

Flight:
* Added a new stock craft, the Learstar A1: A hybrid multistage vessel that functions very much like the Shuttle did.

Crew Management:
* Automatic Crew Hiring is now disabled depending on difficulty setting.

Scenery:
* Tweaked the main terrain shader to use worldspace triplanar mapping on near detail textures. This means we now have enough texture accuracy to texture small rocks or even blades of grass. This is still an ongoing project though, not all Celestial Bodies use this new shader yet.

R&D:
* Entry Purchases in R&D are now required depending on difficulty mode.
* Added a 'Purchase All' button to purchase all parts after researching a node in R&D.

* Fixed several cases of UIs not stopping mouse clicks on objects behind themselves.
* Fixed a bug on OSX which made it impossible to open the Crew Hatch Dialog and possibly other dialogs too.
* Contracts App panel is now scalable in the VAB/SPH

========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.460+) HOTFIX ================================

* This build is a quick hotfix patch to address some issues that managed to slip by testing

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue with loading existing games, which would cause scenario modules (like R&D) to not load properly.
* Fixed an issue which caused Kerbals on EVA to become unresponsive after resuming a save.


========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.459) ====================================

The Asteroid Redirect Mission Patch is a special update in many ways. This time, we've partnered with NASA to produce a completely new set of features for the game.

Main Features:

* Asteroids:
Kerbin is no longer alone in its orbit. Nearby are countless objects that buzz in and out of its sphere of influence, some flying by harmlessly, others on impact trajectories. Ranging in size from just a few meters through 5 size classes up to gigantic objects weighing thousands of tons, these new objects should provide a new challenge for both new and veteran players. Each asteroid is procedurally generated, so no two are the same. Also, asteroids can have samples taken from them by EVAs, providing a constant source of valuable science data, right on the edge of Kerbin's SOI.

* Object Discovery and Tracking:
Before you set out after an asteroid, you first need to identify and track them using the Tracking and Discovery features on the Tracking Station Facility. Select one of the unknown objects spotted near Kerbin, and start tracking it actively to reveal more information about it. Also mind that untracked objects can be lost if they're left unobserved for too long.

* The Advanced Grabbing Unit (aka "The Claw")
As the name probably implies, this new part is the means by which asteroids can be captured to be redirected. Just arm the device, approach the target carefully, and the claw will do the rest. It's like a docking node, but without the need for a mate node on the other side. Better still, the AGU can be used to grab on to much more than just asteroids. In fact, it can pick up just about anything, even Kerbals.

* New SLS-inspired Size 3 parts:
 We've added a host of new parts, featuring the largest engines and fuel tanks ever seen in KSP. These new parts were designed based on NASA's upcoming Space Launch System, and they pack a huge amount of rocket power. Here they are:
 - Size 3 Liquid Fuel + Oxy Tanks, in Full, Half and Quarter-Sized Variants
 - 4x Size 3 Engine Cluster. The single most powerful piece of rocketry we've ever added to KSP.
 - Advanced Size 3 Single-Nozzle Engine, for when you need immense amounts of thrust in your upper stages
 - New Liquid Fuel Booster: A new way to boost your spacecraft, the LFB is a single part featuring twin engines, plus a very respectable amount of fuel. What more, you can even stack more liquid fuel tanks on top of it.
 - The Launch Escape System: Modelled after the Apollo LES, this new escape tower can save your crew should you underestimate the sheer power of your new rockets.

* Completely Overhauled Part Joints:
We have completely re-done the way parts attach to one another, to allow for much greater flexibility and control over each joint. Joints are also more accurate and stable, as both jointed sides are now anchored at the attachment node (this wasn't possible before the Unity 4.3 update).
 - Large parts also have a new system that allows them to attach much more rigidly to other parts, eliminating many cases where spamming struts was required.
 - Increased PhysX's global max angular velocity settings to improve joint stability.
 - Angular inertia values for parts now properly scale with mass. Some ships may feel heavier to fly now, but handling feels much more realistic overall. This also improves joint stability a lot.
 - Re-did the Strut Connector joints as well, to use the new joints system instead of their old ones. This dramatically improved their reliability and significantly reduced the number of ocurrences where ships spontaneously disassemble themselves on the launchpad.



New Features:

* Added new buttons to the Map Filtering panel to filter Unknown and SpaceObject type vessels.
* Focusing vessels on the Tracking Station will now display their patched conics trajectory.
* Added Time Warp controls to the Tracking Station and Space Center scenes.
* Added a button to the Time quadrant in the main flight UI to allow switching betwen Mission Time and Universal Time.
* Targeted vessels now display their trajectories as patched conics instead of single orbits.
* Maneuver Nodes are now persistent.
* Targeted Objects are now persistent.
* Added buttons to discard/accept maneuvers on the delta-v gauge by the navball.
* Added buttons to add/remove an orbit to the date of a maneuver node, allowing nodes to be planned for several orbits ahead.
* Maneuver handles can now be fine-tweaked with the mousewheel when hovering over them.
* RCS and XenonGas containers on earlier stages are now drained before containers on later stages.
* Celestial Bodies now show a 'Focus View' button on their context menus in Map View.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Celestial bodies you have an encounter patch with will display that patch in local mode when they are focused on the Map View or Tracking Station.
* Switching between Linear and Rotation controls in Docking UI mode no longer toggles SAS.
* Fixed a bug where patched conics on extremely eccentric orbits could break the simulation at very high warp speeds.
* Fixed incorrect rendering of ascending and descending nodes when targeting a non-closed orbit.
* Fixed a bug where targeting an object on a hyperbolic orbit wouldn't display rendezvous information on the map.
* Tweaked the thrust and Isp values of Ion Engines and the two tiny rocket engines. All were severely underpowered to be of any practical use.
* Quicksaving is now allowed at all times. In unstable situations, an autosave won't be created at the same time.  
* Greatly improved the accuracy of the physics->rails transition, eliminating drift on nearby vessels when warping during a rendezvous situation, especially high-velocity ones.
* The Map Filtering buttons now toggle independently on left click, and toggle single/all on right click.
* Fixed several cases where Kerbals on EVA would glitch out in very painful ways, mostly when the game changed reference frames while they were in ragdoll state.
* Intersection nodes between orbits no longer 'skip' the closest intersection when placing a maneuver node near the player's position.

==================================== v0.23.0 =========================================================

New:

* The Science Archives:
- Browse through all the science you've done in your Career games in this new section of the R&D Facility. 

* Tweakables:
- Several parts can now be tweaked individually by right-clicking them during construction. 
- Landing Gear can be set to start out deployed or retracted, and can also be made steerable.
- Engines can have a thrust limiter set on them, so you can balance out asymmetrical thruster configurations (or use differential thrust for taxiing).
- Wheels can be tweaked to have their engines toggled, steering locked, all before launch (and after, of course).
- Control Surfaces can be tweaked to toggle response to pitch, roll and yaw input individually. 

* Science Revisited:
- Transmitting scientific data no longer allows you to max out the value of a subject just by repeating the transmission multiple time.
- Removing the experiment data from some experiment modules (for transmission or by EVA) will render them inoperable.
- Resetting an experiment can still be done freely as long as the data is not removed from the module.

* Solar System:
- Added a new Biome Map for Minmus.
- Cleaned up the Biome Maps for Kerbin and the Mun, to remove areas where Biomes would be detected incorrectly.

* The Lab Module:
- Added a new part called a Laboratory Module, which allows experiment data and samples to be processed before transmission, increasing their science value.
- The Lab Module requires 2 crews inside to operate and a whole lot of power as well. 
- Added a new button to the experiment review dialog to process collected data on the Lab if one is available (and operational) on your vessel.

* EVA Data Transport:
- Kerbals on EVA can now collect the data from experiment modules and store them on crew-carrying modules.
- Kerbals can also collect data from other data container modules, including other Kerbals.
- EVAs can also store samples collected from other experiments on the Lab. 

* Part Tooltips Overhaul:
- The tooltips that pop up when mousing over a part on the editors have been completely redesigned.
- The tooltips show essential info only at first, but can be expanded to show more info with RMB.
- Once expanded, you can right-click again to collapse, or to pin other tooltips if you hover over other parts.
- Re-organized the part information to group stats for each module and resource container on a part.
- Added a larger icon for the part on the tooltip itself, featuring a scale to give an idea of size before picking. 

* All-around Optimizations:
- We've gone over all our code to make sure it runs as efficiently as possible.
- Upgraded to Unity version 4.2.2 to make full use of its own bugfixes and tweaks.
- Texture loading has been sped up, loading times are noticeably reduced.

* [Windows-Only] 6-DOF Device Support:
- 6-DOF input devices such as the Space Navigator are now supported both as camera and flight controllers.
- Scroll Lock will toggle the device mode in flight.
- Due to driver limitations this is a Windows-only feature for now. We're ready to implement support in OSX and Linux as soon as those drivers become available.


Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Parts:
- The logic for all-vessel resource flow (such as Electric Charge and MonoPropellant) has been re-done. 
- Fixed those resource containers not being able to drain fully or store an amount larger than their current available space.

* Docking:
- Fixed an issue that caused docking ports to resume their states incorrectly after docking, making it impossible to undock afterwards.
- Fixed a big issue with docking operations through physicsless parts in the hierarchy between the port and the original vessel root.

* EVAs:
- EVAs now use actual MonoPropellant for their jetpacks, instead of their own fuel. 
- Fixed an issue with collision resolution that caused EVAs to sometimes fall over and become uncontrollable.
- Kerbals other than you will now pick themselves up from ragdoll state if they are involved in any 'accidents' or are flat out being used as Kerbowling pins.
- Parts that land onto splashed-down parts are now considered to be landed. This allows EVAs to walk on floating platforms.

* Other Fixes:
- The Return key will no longer reset the staging sequence in the Editors, or return you to the Main Menu at KSC.
- The Main Menu now remembers the 'page' you were at when you left it, so if you return from a loaded game, you'll find it still at the "Start Game" screen.
- Fixed several issues with joystick axis mapping and indexing.
- Updated the Input settings screen to expose a few new control options that weren't accessible before.
- Fixed an issue that could lead to loss of GUI responsiveness after leaving flight during reentry or supersonic flight.

- The antennas are now functional, and can be used to transmit science data back to Kerbin, if recovering the physical experiments is not an option.
- Antennas consume massive amounts of power when transmitting. Make sure you have fresh batteries in.
- Added a new deployable antenna, which is an intermediate model compared to the two original ones.
- Completely remodelled the Communotron 88-88 Comms Dish. The new mesh uses the same placement rules so it won't break ships that have it.

* Windows and OSX Installers:
- The KSPStore version of the game can now also be downloaded as an installer wizard on Windows, and as a .dmg image on OSX.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
* Fixed an issue that caused a stream of errors to be thrown after planting a flag and opening the map.
* Fixed several minor and not-so-minor issues with scene transitions.

- Added completely new Launch Dialogs on the Runway and Launchpad at the Space center.
- The new Astronaut Complex dialog allows you to hire crews from a list of Applicants, and view the status of all your crewmembers.
- Revised the crew handling game logic, for a much more reliable and robust system.

* SAS Modules:
- Rewrote the SAS control logic from the ground up.
- SAS is now enabled for the entire vessel, and requires actuators like winglets, RCS or others to actually have an effect.
- Repurposed the old SAS modules are now Reaction Wheel Modules, that apply torque while consuming electricity.
- The new SAS logic allows applying manual input while SAS is on, letting you set the ship's attitude without having to constantly toggle it.

* Procedural Terrain:

* Un-warping a landed ship will no longer cause an unphysical jerk on it, which could possibly destroy it.
* Landed/Splashed vessels no longer show an Apoapsis icon on the Map View.
* The Map Camera now responds to the keyboard bindings for camera zoom.

* RCS Fuel Tanks now drain symmetrically if placed using symmetry.


==================================== v0.13.3 (Demo)===================================================

New:
* A Stats Tracking System, so we can collect information of the game for statistical purposes.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB. 
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.
* Fixed a bug that caused symmetrical parts to lose the reference to one of their counterparts, leading to incorrect symmetrical placements. 
* Reverted the Staging logic to the 13.1 system, as the changes made in 13.2 were buggy. 


==================================== v0.13.2 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB.
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.
* Fixed a bug that caused symmetrical parts to lose the reference to one of their counterparts, leading to incorrect symmetrical placements. 

==================================== v0.13.1 ======================================================

* Official Release

Bug Fixes:
* Removed parent-wise fuel crossfeed from Radial Decouplers. Fuel Lines made that obsolete.
* Fixed an issue that prevented attachment nodes from affecting connected part rotations properly.
* Fixed an issue with the part loader, which would crash if a binary mesh was found, but no .dae or .obj file was present.


==================================== v0.13.1x1 ====================================================

New:
* Recompiled on the latest version of the Unity engine, to add multithreaded rendering support and better memory management.
* Changed the Fuel Line flow direction, so fuel will flow from the first-placed end of the line to the second end.
* Holding Ctrl and clicking on a part on the ship at the VAB will now automatically flip the parts list to the selected part's page.
* Added in-game credits

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the custom part sounds loading system, which wasn't working on the last release.
* The part loader will no longer freeze if it cannot find a part module to load. It will load the base Part module, and make it visible but unavailable on the VAB.


==================================== v0.13.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.13.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Increased the heat conductivity and heat dissipation values for all parts, to compensate for the new heat exchange system.
* Fixed the time quadrant on the UI being unresponsive to mouse clicks if there were part icons behind it.
* Fixed the staging quadrant being partially visible in the map view.
* Fixed a problem that made it possible to delete the command pod in the VAB by using Ctrl+Z.


==================================== v0.13.0x3 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Tweaked the part heat exchange model, for a considerable fps boost with very large ships

New:
* Added a new icon for the Fuel Line parts.
* Changed the icon grouping rule on RCS Blocks and Strut Connectors to group to all parts of the same type on it's stage.


==================================== v0.13.0x2 ====================================================

New:
* Pressing F2 will hide the UI completely (so you can take UI-free screenshots).

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the weird 'glass-like' artifacts in game during launch
* Fixed the parts not receiving mouse events on the VAB. This also affected collision detection on the VAB.
* Fixed the in-flight settings screen being drawn under the main UI.
* Tweaked the fuel tank surface attachment point. It was a little too close to the collider, and sometimes caused false collisions.
* Fixed a bug with the parts code that allowed them to bypass receiving gravity and drag forces if it's hierarchy root was destroyed.
* Fixed the map camera code so that it will remember where it was if you re-open it. (this tweak was left out of the X1 build apparently)
* Fixed the part icon numbers (when multiple icons are grouped) not being positioned correctly on a few resolutions.



==================================== v0.13.0x1 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Removed a lot of needless halts on the part processing routine during loading.
* Restructured the sound loading system so the main loading thread doesn't wait for it to finish before moving on.
* Deferred adding of several part components so they're only added when they're needed.
* Mesh tangents can now be loaded from file, instead of being recalculated every time.
* The mesh loader now ignores materials from file, because they were going to be replaced anyway later.
* Meshes are now saved to binary files (serialized) when loaded for the first time, and loaded from those files when they're available.
* Changed the rendering method for the part icons on the staging sequence. This can prevent thousands of objects from being created when flying large ships.
* Ship parts now have adjustable levels of physics, so small parts are not as deeply simulated as large ones. This reduces the amount of physics objects and joints to simulate.
* Reduced the amount of code components attached to each part, making for less calls on each frame.


New:
* The part loader will check if the saved optimized meshes are out-of-date, and update them when necessary.
* A new Fuel Line part, that allows fuel to be drained off external (side-mounted) tanks.
* It is now possible to warp time freely when the ship is landed.
* Added a progress bar for the loading screen.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the mission timer not getting started if the first stage was moved before launching.
* Liquid Fuel now flows from the "top" attachment node, instead of from the parent part (unless there is no top node, in which case it flows from the parent part).
* Parts now keep the references to the part attached in each attachment node. (makes top-node based fuel flow possible)
* Fixed a bug which prevented the ship selection dialogs from receiving double-click events. Now it is possible to select a ship file by double clicking on it.
* Improved rendering of hyperbolic (escape) orbits in the map view. The trajectory is now a constant size regardless of eccentricity, and isn't warped by the splines.
* The Map camera will now remember it's last position, and return to it when the map is reopened.

NOTES: 
* The new part loading system will generate optimized meshes for all parts whenever it finds new part models. This means the first time you run the game, it might take longer for loading to complete.

* This update introduces some new features that make ships built on previous versions incompatible. If a ship fails to load, it's because it isn't compatible with this version. We apologize for the inconvenience.

==================================== v0.12.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.12.0x5 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Removed the SAS disabling itself when going into Map View or into high warp rates.
* Implemented a new Kepler Equation solver for extremely high eccentricity orbits, the old one was becoming unstable and freezing the game.

==================================== v0.12.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with the Floating Origin system which caused the ship to jitter on very high warp rates and speeds. (aka The Warp Shakes)
* Fixed another problem which could cause the game to crash if entering/leaving another planet's SOI while on 1x or 2x warp.
* (Hopefully) fixed a problem with 0 inclination orbits that could cause them to become reversed or rotated when transitioning between planets/moons.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem that caused ships to reverse direction when unwarping while on a hyperbolic orbit.
* Fixed a few typos in some part descriptions.

* Fixed the Max G reading on the flight end screen. Now it will only log sustained G forces.
* Fixed the Surface/Orbital Speed reading getting messed up when restarting a flight.
* Fixed a problem with the Time Warp code, that would sometimes force the time rate to 2x, but not unpack the ship. It would also cause G forces and other values to be incorrectly calculated.
* Fixed a problem with unpacking the ship for physics that could cause centers of mass to be offset, leading to uncontrollable tumbling.
* Fixed a problem that could cause orbits to become reversed when entering/leaving another planet's sphere of influence.
* Changed the Time Warp altitude restrictions to be proportional to the current planet or moon's radius.


==================================== v0.12.0x1 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Improved the way velocities are applied when resuming physics.
* Fixed the Advanced SAS icon showing as a question mark on the VAB.
* Fixed a bug where cloning parts by removing and undoing would cause them to receive duplicate IDs (and crash the game when loading the ship again).
* Tidied up the flight statistics numbers formatting a bit, so they're easier to make sense of.
* Time Warp will now smoothly increase/decrease towards the set time rate, for a much more fluid transition.
* Made several improvements to the Map View orbit rendering.
* Fixed the rails->physics transition, so that there is no significant change anymore in orbital parameters when going out of warp.
* Made some significant improvements to the physical joints that hold the ship together. Ships will not wobble anymore when going back into 1x time after warping, and the joints themselves are more stable overall.
* Made a small tweak to the part tooltips on the VAB, to prevent them from going off-screen on small resolutions. (was noticeable with the new command pod selection dialog)

* Orbital time was running much faster than it should at 2x and 4x warp.
* Fixed the Kepler Equation solver in the orbit system, which was causing a number of problems when going into and out of high warp rates.
* Going into warp above 4x now is only possible if no forces are being applied on the ship
* Improved formatting on orbital node display numbers, to make it easier to tell  the difference between 10,000m and 100,000m

* Fixed a bug with the solid boosters, where they would become heavier instead of lighter as their fuel was spent.


==================================== v0.10.0x2 ================================================

New:
* Added a Throttle (Incremental) binding to the input config. This allows mapping an axis to control the throttle, much like the W/S keys do.
