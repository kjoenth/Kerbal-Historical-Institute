ChangeLog:
=================================== v1.5.1 ============================================================
+++ Bugfixes
* Fix Aero body lift in flight integrator.

+++ Includes 1.5.0 Changes
+++ Improvements
* Optimized the game for 4K resolution and increased the UI scale to 200%
* Added higher impact tolerance to retracted solar panels.
* Deployable parts now use separate value for their impact resistance when retracted.
* Implemented a new version of the kerbal suits for the base game. This includes IVA suits for recruits and veterans as well as EVA suits.
* Revised the behaviour of asteroids within Kerbin's SOI and gave them better VFX.
* Added a "What's New" dialog to the main menu, where you can quickly see the highlights of the release as well as the full change log. (you're probably reading this from that very dialog).
* Improved Burn Time information on Maneuver nodes. Includes correctly calculated burn time and Stage Information; Burn bar indication when vessel does not have enough DeltaV to perform the maneuver.
* Staging of docking ports now available in flight. Changing staging of docking ports allows the player to change the Delta-V of the vessel for docked vessels which changes the Burn Time Information on Maneuver nodes.

=================================== v1.2.0 ============================================================
+++Unity 5.4
* Engine change from 5.2 to 5.4.0p4

+++Libraries and Packages
* Implemented Text Mesh Pro, which basically vectorizes all of our fonts, making them look much better, especially at larger font sizes. Also has a lot of extra utility that we can leverage for various effects.
* Upgraded Vectrosity to latest version.
* Upgraded Vehicle Physics Pro to latest version.

+++Code cleanup
* Heavily reduced garbage generation caused by foreach loops, Linq usage, and various other things.
* Made sure that all of our singleton classes properly clean themselves up.
* Optimized KerbalEVA.
* Rewrote CrewManifest and related crew handling (roster, vessel crew list, etc).
* Optimized PartModules.
* Optimize latitude/longitude/altitude calls to often use a combined get-all method.
* Fix how some enumerator interfaces are declared in classes.
* Optimized waypoint site name generation to generate a lot less garbage with its string lists.
* Many part modules now cache parts instead of polling the entire vessel multiple times per frame.
* Revised how most forces and torques are applied (see note on this subject below in Moddability).
* Added DoubleCurve
* ScenarioModules now awake and load during game load and so are valid in modules' OnStart.
* Considerable work to Krakensbane and FloatingOrigin to improve precision and performance and lower garbage.
* Various ISRU fixes and performance improvements.
* Default KSPEvents and KSPActions to being nonpersistent in terms of state. This means all their fields won't be serialized/deserialized to and from the save game files.
* Now always use g0 = 9.80665 and G (big G) = 6.67408e-11 for gravitational constants.

+++Flow Overhaul
* Rewrote resource flow entirely. Now just four flow modes. Can set per-tank priority for all but AllVessel and NoFlow. Surface crossfeed for rocket engines as well as jets. Fixed priority issues. Much faster. PartResources no longer MonoBehaviours. Can set crossfeed per attach node. Electric Charge now uses STAGE_PRI so can be prioritized. Resource transfer in flight can be set to require valid crossfeed for those resources which obey crossfeed. With Advanced Tweakables on, can see flow graph in VAB/SPH (right-click on a part).

+++SAS
* Fixed SAS unlocking for all ships in physics range when maneuvering the ship in focus.
* The code for the older "Stability Assist" and somewhat newer "Pilot Steering" modes has been unified.
* SAS now dynamically adjusts for the vessel's mass properties and available control authority.
* SAS uses a "stability decay" method to reduce oscillations (or twitching) when very near the target orientation.
* Pilot Steering modes now include a "coast" and "stop" mode when transitioning between steering points.

+++Wheels
* WheelColliders are now properly handled by collision manager, and no longer require the wheel "blocking" workaround to clip into other parts.
* Fix hill "sticking" force overcompensating, resulting in a not so slow drift uphill when parked on one with wheels or legs.
* Wheel deployment modules now search along the animation timeline upon retraction for the time closest to where the wheel suspension is located, instead of starting from 100%. This fixes the hop when retracting landing legs.
* Added tweakable that allows player to specify whether his wheels deploy while shielded in a cargo bay.
* Fix landing legs being exported to the wrong collision layer.
* Wheel gravity is now properly handled in a standard manner, which should fix a good deal of instability.
* Fix EVA kerbals blowing up wheels on contact. They now go through them.
* Fixed landing legs teleporting from a semi-deployed state to a semi-retracted state when retracted.
* Wheel damage does not process damage for two seconds after a vessel loads, prevents spontaneous explosions.
* Suspension colliders are no longer disabled for 0.5 seconds upon retract, causing them to fall through the ground momenarily, blowing up your engines.
* Deployable landing gear and legs now have deployment sounds.

+++Communications Networks
* Additional functionality and gameplay components to the Antenna and Probe parts through a series of distinct but related mechanics. When CommNet is enabled, probes will require a connection back to Kerbin or to a control point to have full control, and crewed vessels lacking pilots will have slightly limited control without such a connection. Relays can extend the range of such connections and bounce signals around planets and moons that would otherwise occlude. Science transmission receives a bonus for high signal strength. New antenna parts allow building complex networks, which can be visualized in map view. See KSPedia for more details.

+++KerbNet
* Added KerbNet, which allows the player to see terrain under their satellite, and place custom waypoints with a targeting interface. Allows the player to see biomes and anomalies at higher levels. Scan field of view for KerbNet varies by part and smoothly changes between surface altitude and orbital altitude.
* KerbNet allows all probes and labs manned by a scientist to map as long as they have a communications network connection that eventually bounces to Kerbin.
* Gave KerbNet visibility modes to hide some of the interface around the map.
* Gave KerbNet auto-refresh settings to allow it to refresh without player intervention.
* Gave KerbNet enhanced mode, which activates on some vessels such as rovers to give them better sensors in certain situations.
* Add game option that allows KerbNet to either orient to the orbit normal, preventing flipping when passing over the poles, or to orient to north, which is less disorienting for some players.
* Many aspects of KerbNet given flavor and fluff. Scanning a sun results in yellow and white noise, scanning a gas giant is similar except hued based on that planet. Stars and scan static can appear in the background past the horizon of a scan.
* Resources can specify a scientific abbreviation. Utilized in KerbNet for the mode icon.

+++Debug Window
* Completely overhauled the debug window to utilize new Unity GUI.
* New debug console has syntax highlighting that highlights classes with persistent pastel colors if they bracket their names. [Bracket] your class names in debug logs modders.
* New debug console has command input support which is moddable, type /help for a full listing of commands, and what they do.
* Added new debug screen for creating kerbals with specific names, genders, skills, levels, and classes.
* Debug options for displaying errors/exceptions as screen messages.
* Added set orbit debug cheat screen.
* Added rendezvous controls to set orbit debug cheat screen.

+++Orbits
* All anomalies (ObT, mean anomaly, eccentric anomaly, true anomaly) are now consistently negative when approaching the periapsis for both elliptical and hyperbolic trajectories (previously, only hyperbolic trajectories used negative anomalies). This means that eccentric anomaly and true anomaly are now in the range -pi..pi instead of 0..2pi for elliptical trajectories.
* Reference frames instead of quaternions are used for calculating orbital position and velocity, leading to increased speed when rendering patched conics.
* Improved precision in orbit calculations.
* Rewrote orbit targeting / closest approach finding.
* Fixed issues where objects jump when going on and off rails.
* Fix target orientation markers when the target is on rails.
* Refactored such that orbital position and velocity and vessel position and velocity are correct for the FixedUpdate cycle.
* Made target relative velocity work for celestial bodies.
* Trajectories that re-encounter a body just escaped are now detected.
* Trajectories that encounter two bodies now correctly show the first encounter even if it is further out (eg, Mun stealing a Minmus encounter).
* Elliptical encounter trajectories no longer flicker.
* Conic patch settings (draw mode and limit) are now exposed in the Video Settings.
* Added game option for legacy orbit targeting.
* Map node labels space themselves out nicely when cluttered.
* Targeting info for moons in other SoIs now works.

+++Contracts
* Contracts are now also weighted by celestial body, so if the player starts declining contracts to Jool, they will see them less often.
* Contracts now keep track of if they have been viewed. There are three states: unseen, seen but not clicked, and clicked and read.
* Contract weighting now applies negative weight if a contract has been viewed when it expires.
* Exploration contracts now always appear in Mission Control if there is not one currently available.
* Explore contracts overhauled, they now utilize the same logic World Firsts used to use to select a "package" of related objectives. They can appear multiple times per planet now, and should have a much more logical progression than they used to.
* Exploration contract progression slowed slightly, now requires science on a planet before allowing a fly by of the next one. Also, in the early game, return from orbit and return from fly by are required before advancing on the Muns of the homeworld.
* Removed old single objective World First contracts, other than the initial four.
* Waypoint captions for survey contracts now state the altitude band of each waypoint.
* Fix contract orbits not cleaning up properly when their contracts are cancelled as opposed to completed.
* Grand tour contracts now require a new vessel to complete, so they cannot be cheesed by keeping one around that has seen every planet.
* Fix contextual surveys not properly bouncing the navigation waypoint.
* Asteroid recovery objective reworded and given a note for clarity.
* Asteroid side objectives in facility construction contracts will now not appear unless the same requirements for asteroid recovery contracts to appear are met.
* Crew transfer progress tracking objective reworded to make it clear that it does not need to utilize existing crew.
* Reworded objective to hold above a waypoint in stationary orbit contracts for clarity.
* If Kerbal G limits are enabled, tourists can either require going unconscious or require not going unconscious during the trip. Check the parameter details!
* Adjusted Exploration contract flavor text to work better in multi-objective scenarios.

+++Biomes
* Biomes for many bodies have been redesigned for clarity, beauty, and utility. And we've hidden a few extra surprises around as well!

+++Easter Eggs
* Added hidden fun stuff to almost every planet.
* Mohole given an empty PQSCity, which allows it to appear in KerbNet.
* Gave many easter eggs colliders.
* Fix Duna's SSTV not playing.
* Unburied Duna's MSL.

+++Other Work
* Advanced Tweakables option in Gameplay Settings. With it off, some advanced features are hidden. Defaults off.
* Autostrutting available for all parts (AT).
* Autostruts can be gated behind a technology in career and science mode defined in Physics.cfg, by default it is the same technology regular struts are on.
* Add grandparent mode to auto-struts.
* Parachutes can have automatic holding of deployment until safe (AT).
* Actuation toggles now affect symmetry counterparts in editor (some other RCS/gimbal bits do too). Also hidden under Advanced Tweakables (AT).
* Utilize HSV color space in more locations.
* Quadrupled the amount of loading screen messages. You know, the important stuff.
* Loads of new options in the difficulty settings.
* Science data can be transferred by the part-part transfer mechanic (for certain probe cores).
* Added physics easing for when landed/splashed vessels come off rails.
* Certain probe cores (and the new science container part) can transfer data with no EVA required.
* There is an additional drag curve whose function is to raise drag coefficient to a power based on the mach number. This leads to blunter things having (relatively) more drag supersonic than they did and pointier things having (relatively) less than they did. Pods will slow down better on steep reentries and planes will produce drag in better proportion to how streamlined they are (less overpowered airplane drag).
* Fairings now include support for placing multiple payloads in them (and showing trusses for said payloads).
* Tourist contracts work better with the Kerbal Gee Tolerance option.
* Add a small negative contract weight for contracts that are read but not accepted.
* Existing resource narrow band scanner ported to KerbNet interface, allowing it to zoom, among other things.
* Removed biome readout information and flag rendering on narrow band scanner.
* Added ellipsis to many text labels and fields, to prevent overflow while looking nice.
* Input keys in the settings screen automatically expand with screen resolution.
* Default parachute deployment mode set to "when safe" - players everywhere rejoice.
* All tooltips cooked to a nice golden color.
* Added Viewmatic Survey Satellite stock relay craft.
* Added /b4d455 command, which starts a game off with basically everything.
* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades smoothly between birds by day and crickets by night.
* Background ambiance in the space center scene now fades out when at max time warp.
* Background ambiance in general no longer always starts at zero, it randomly seeks when the scene loads. Hence, loading a game no longer immediately plays the exact same bird trill.
* Most stock planes given a look over based on player feedback.
* Added editor part categories for ground, electrical, communication, thermal, payload, and coupling parts.
* Screen message text given much higher visibility.
* Facilities in the space center now have verbose context menus in sandbox mode, allowing you to see their upgrades. They always show the maximum level of upgrades.
* "Require Complete" on antennae is now persistent and its state is saved.
* Added community contest winner kerbal and unique waypoint names.
* Camera can now be pointed at parts, not just vessel center of mass.
* Added Plane and Relay vessel types/icons.
* Airbrakes now have deployment limits.
* Rebalance fairing panel mass downwards slightly.
* Difficulty options for limiting part pressure and G-force tolerance.
* Difficulty option for kerbal G-force tolerance. Kerbals go unconscious if their tolerance is exceeded.
* Slight performance tweaks to some early 1.25m engines.
* Swap around some early science parts in the tech tree.
* Redid Eve's atmospheric pressure curve to smooth it out and remove errors. Eve's atmosphere thins out much faster now, so the high atmosphere is thinner. Also tweaked Jool's atmosphere so it rapidly goes from 15 atmospheres to 50 in the last few kilometers to achieve crushing pressures.
* Can right-click on icons in the staging list to trigger the Part Action Window.
* Support Rigid Attachment (non-bendy) option for part joints in cfg and in the PAW.
* Added an "Action Groups Always Allowed" advanced difficulty option.
* Add 0.625m heat shield.
* Lift from capsules and heat shields better handled to make lifting reentries better (easier).
* Restructured in-flight pause menu to better show all options.
* Don't lock all controls when using Warp To, only some.
* Fix terrain vanishing at 1000m depth.
* Allow targeting of close vessels by double-clicking.
* Angle the canopies of parachutes in symmetry away from each other.
* Resource transfer rate when transferring between parts now based on ingame time (taking warp into account) not realtime.
* Fix issues with TR-2L stats.
* Show tooltips on kerbal portraits.
* Fix scientist skill text.
* Fix issue with ladders not being re-grab-able if you board a seat, retract a ladder, leave the seat, then extend the ladder.
* Update maneuver node patches (for targeting) when the vessel target changes.
* The runway lights now follow the day/night cycle.
* Moved a low tech wheel to a lower tech tier.

+++Moddability
API Docs: https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/index.html
* Added FlightGlobals.VesselsLoaded and FlightGlobals.VesselsUnloaded which lets us iterate over a specific portion of Vessels without checking the entire list.
* Added onVesselPartCountChanged event, fires any time a part is added or removed, the moment it happens, unlike onVesselModified.
* Added onVesselStandardModification event, collects various vessel events and fires them off with a single one. (onVesselPartCountChanged, onVesselModified, docked, undocked, et al)
* Added onScreenResolutionModified event, fires when the screen resolution is modified.
* Added many accessors/setters.
* Vessel control level can be clamped to a field in Vessel (so can be restricted to Partial even if otherwise would be Full).
* GetModuleMass/Cost methods can now be passed the situation.
* Fix where kerbal mass (if set to nonzero) was not applied in the editor.
* Added two new dictionary-related classes (DictionaryValueList and ListDictionary).
* Celestial bodies now cache all of their PQS Cities.
* All game root nodes now generate a random persistent seed, which is different from game to game.
* All forces on valid parts except wheel forces are now done via Part.AddForce/Torque/AddForceAtPosition. Note that the forcemode used is Force; to use a different forcemode, convert the force to the correct amount. It is the job of the Flight Integrator to then apply all these forces to actual rigidbodies (rather than all the disparate modules' job).
* Use mass-weighted average angular velocity of parts for vessel angular velocity.
* ITorqueProvider now reports two Vector3s, positive torque (that produced by control actuation 1,1,1) and negative torque (that produced by -1,-1,-1).
* Added various accessors.
* Node definitions can take an extra digit after size, either 0 or 1: that sets whether the node can crossfeed. Defaults to 1 (yes). NODE definitions can take crossfeed = True/False
* ModuleEngines now supports `clampPropReceived = True`. This will clamp the ratio of propellant requested based on prior results, so if IntakeAir is listed first and less than the full requirement is returned, it will request only that ratio of further propellants. In this case the "Prop Req Met" display will show the minimum requirement-met ratio rather than the average. Engines that use IntakeAir (or other cases like that) need to have `clampPropReceived = True` in each of their MODULEs that do that, and need to have that PROPELLANT first and the other PROPELLANTs later. See stock jet cfgs for examples.
* Added another crew transfer event.
* Added more startup options for KSPAddon
* Allow kerbals to have/save/load arbitrary experience points.
* ResearchAndDevelopment.GetTechnologyTitle(string id) will convert a tech ID to a tech title and is available as soon as parts start loading (can be used in GetInfo() ).
* Support max pressure (dynamic + static), `maxPressure`, and max G, `gTolerance`, for parts.
* Added system to allow mods to add custom difficulty settings.
* Added CelestialBody.hasSurface so mods that add a PQSController to gas giant don't cause silly things such as "Plant a flag on Jool" contracts.
* Replaced all checks for experience traits (Pilot, Scientist, Engineer) with individual experience effects. They are now loaded before part loading so can be queried in GetInfo().
* Icons in TechTree.cfg can now use a relative path (allows mod icons to live outside the Squad directory).
* Added KSPAssemblyDependencyEqualMajor as an attribute. Use instead of KSPAssemblyDependency if you want to force requiring the stated major version, not >= the major version, from your dependency.
* If you are setting a vessel's position and/or changing its orbit, call Vessel.IgnoreGForces(framecount) on the vessel for the number of frames that g forces should be ignored (try 1, then 2 if that doesn't work, etc).
* ModuleDeployablePart (covers antennas, solars, radiators) also has a gResistance (for Gs) as well as windResistance (for Q).
* Crew transfer now derives from a generic abstract PartItemTransfer class. Classes can derive from it to implement any kind of (crew transfer-style) part-part transfer. Also we fire an event right before a crew transfer is created so mods can just kill it and easily create their own CrewTransfer-derived class and have that be called on that event.
* Extended ModuleScienceContainer to allow sending and, (from ModuleScienceExperiment) receiving, experiment data. Also added support for a Collect All option to such containers.
* ModuleColorChanger supports changing arbitrary shader colors and implements IScalarModule. ModuleAnimationSetter works similarly and is used to more directly link an animation to being set by IScalarModule.
* PartModules now support upgrades. In a MODULE node, add an UPGRADE node. Inside that add one node per techID you wish to provide upgrades, in ascending order. Inside that place keys and nodes you wish to upgrade. e.g. `UPGRADES { basicRocketry { maxThrust = 250 } }` will change maxThrust to 250 once basicRocketry unlocks. Upgrades will never override persistent data. Further, by default they overwrite each other; to make a node apply on a clean slate (so you can, say, add two PROPELLANT nodes and not have them conflict due to the overwrite logic) set `IsExclusiveUpgrade__ = True` in the upgrade's node. That will clear the upgrade state and apply that upgrade fresh. Upgrades are applied only when you add a part to a craft in the VAB/SPH, they don't magically apply in flight. When a part on a craft is upgraded, a new option will appear in the PAW (when in VAB/SPH) where you can view the current stats of all those modules with upgrades.
* ModuleEngines now supports alternate (RealFuels-style) throttling and rates.
* ModuleEngines now supports throttle-Isp interactions. Turn on with useThrottleIspCurve = True and set the throttleIspCurve and throttleIspCurveAtmStrength curves. Final Isp = input Isp * Lerp(1, throttleIspCurve.Eval(throttle state), throttleIspCurveAtmStrength.Eval(atms of pressure))
* Support part upgrades, see docs.
* Added events dealing with kerbals going on/off ladders on parts and added a new vessel field for accessing the vessel of the part of the ladder the kerbal is climbing (if all of those are valid).
* CelestialBody now has thermo/atmo stats methods so FlightIntegrator's temperature calcs can be called from anywhere / any mod.
* Events that throw an exception now print the full stack trace.
* PartModuleUtil.PrintResourceSI() is now just KSPUtil.PrintSI().
* Add ModuleDragAreaModifier with field areaFactor. Note: this will also affect buoyancy and thermo.
* Added ModuleHeatEffects and FXModuleThrottleEffects which can take any number of IScalarModules and are set by skin temp and throttle respectively.
* AvailablePart.entryCost is now get-only and calls a static delegate so they can be 
* FindEngineNearby and FindEngineInterface are now PartModuleList methods instead of being duplicates in FXModuleAnimateThrottle and ModuleAlternator.
* Many KerbalEVA, Kerbal, and KerbalExpressionSystem methods made virtual, and kerbal spawning in ProtoCrewMember and EVA spawning in FlightEVA made delegates.
* Added IContractObjectiveModule, which allows mods to specify valid parts for contract objectives, rather than it being configuration based.
* Waypoint captions on the map are now moddable.
* Added game events for CommNet status changes both for the connection in general and the connection to KSC.
* Added game event that fires when PQS starts, just before the sphere is started.
* Added game event that fires when PQSCities start.
* Added game event for orbital resource survey completion.
* Added game event for vessel control state changing.
* Orbit now has a constructor that clones another orbit.
* Vessel now has a method to kill all parts in permanent ground contact (eg: launch clamps).
* Added ModuleGenerator.isGroundFixture for launch clamps.
* The "escape" progress milestone now uses standard World First award methods, which allows it to be disabled by mods properly.
* Icon_Hidden tag now hides all children of the transform so tagged.
* Add requiresFullControl to events, actions, and UI controls. If false, will work normally in full and partial control and refuse to work only with no control. If true, will work only with full control.
* AssemblyLoader ignores abstract classes.
* Support symbols in the font.
* Made Kerbals and EVA kerbals more moddable. EVAs and the flag now have partial part cfgs which can be modded. All Kerbal and KerbalEVA methods are virtual and the FSM is opened up. New hooks added.
* Made vessel load/unload/pack/unpack ranges changeable in Physics.cfg.
* Support adding options to the game difficulty screen.
* Vessel now has radarAltitude. Use it for min(altitude, heightFromTerrain)
* add PartModule.OnIconCreate which runs just before the partmodule is stripped from the icon gameobject when the editor part icon is being created.
* Particle systems can be registered with FloatingOrigin for handling origin/krakensbane offsetting natively.
* ProtoPartResourceSnapshot no longer relies on strings, and its resourceValues node is now inaccessible. Instead, directly get / set the amount/maxAmount/flowState.
* PartModules now come with a resHandler object (of type ModuleResourceHandler) for handling ModuleResource / RESOURCE nodes, so code need not be duplicated.
* When a landed vessel goes off rails and is detected to be landed on parts, not the ground, it is offset up slightly, controlled by one static Vessel field HeightFromPartOffsetGlobal (default 0.5 meters) and one instance field heightFromPartOffsetLocal (default 0 meters). The vessel is offset upwards the sum of those two fields.
* Fix OnVesselSwitching always sending a null reference, add OnVesselSwitchingUnloaded.
* Allow reference to Kerbal's animator cache and renderer cache.
* Add map toggle interface for mods.
* OrbitTargeter opened up, delegate added for creating the on-click context menus so they can be modded.
* Add delegates so KB apps can be modded.
* Add currency-agnostic CanAfford method.
* Add many more options to ModuleLiftingSurface and for customizing body lift.
* ModuleAnimateGeneric now supports defaultActionGroup.
* ConfigNode now formats float and double values such that no data is lost.
* ConfigNode AddValue/SetValue now support most types.

=================================== v1.1.1 ============================================================

UI:
* Added FlightUI Element Scaling and Navball Position Slider.

Wheels:
* Added auto-struts to every wheel, similar to fairing payload struts. They attach to the most massive part on the vessel. This prevents wheel suspensions from becoming unstable when the wheel is attached to a weaker part. (Attaching legs to pylons no longer causes vessels to bounce and/or break dance.)
* Fix suspension distance and offset being inversely proportional to the rescaleFactor of a wheel. Fixes LT-1 and LT-2 leg suspensions actually getting smaller despite scale being larger, causing them to visually sink into the ground, and have shorter useful suspensions.
* Some configuration tweaks suggested by GoSlash27 for the free and fixed landing gears have been integrated, which dramatically improve issues with instability on those gears. Thank you GoSlash27!
* Fixed some model hierarchy issues with small and medium retractable landing gears, which fixes some odd suspension forces, an animation issue, and the inability to lock the suspension on these gears.
* Raise the default integration substeps on wheels from 4 to 8, which should dramatically improve the accuracy of the wheel simulation without affecting performance too much.
* Added separate settings for wheel integrator substep accuracy for active and inactive vessels, which can be tweaked in each wheel's part configuration, or globally from settings.cfg. Inactive vessels get slightly less accuracy to improve performance.
* "No crash damage" cheat now prevents wheels from blowing up their parts due to gratuitously large impacts. It does not, however, prevent the wheel from entering the damaged state.
* Halved the deflection magnitude of free and fixed gears, as they are technically much more rigid than other gears, but their lack of suspension travel makes them much more vulnerable to deflection stress, making them twice as tough.

Editor:
* Performed significant optimisation of performance intensive areas such as part attaching and dettaching. 
* Implemented general optimisation throughout editor.
* Implemented automatic temporary symmetry when the logic expects the symmetry mode or method to be different. I.e when placing engines on tri-couplers in SPH using mirror mode. Fixes part initialization issues.

Contracts:
* Added Station and Base Contextual Contracts, requiring you to modify/expand existing bases and stations
* Added Satellite Contextual Contracts, requiring maintenance operations to previously deployed satellites
* Added Survey Contextual Contracts, which target existing landed vessels to request (applicable) survey missions of them
* Part Test contract generation logic has been modified. Each part now has a much more specific set of constraints before it generates, to give it much more consistent and realistic altitudes, speeds, and envelopes.
* Passive Progress Rewards: gives a light reward automatically to any new achievement. These are given independently of accepted World-Firsts Contracts, but are not as substantial.
* Contract Decline Penalty: A small reputation penalty is incurred when a contract is declined, to prevent Mission Control from being abused as a slot machine.
* New early game part haul contracts - easier part tests that only require you to bring the payload to a designated location.
* Early game focused surveys balanced to be much more forgiving.
* New part tests added for fairings and heat shields.
* Many milestones added that involve the player doing hidden fun stuff.

Strategies:
* Added Leadership Initiative Strategy: increases passive rewards for achievements, at the cost of reduced contract rewards. Useful to boost self-driven playstyles.

Progress Tracking:
* Added new World First contract types for space walking, crew transfers, and flight on atmospheric planets.
* There is also now a fourth record "track" for oceanic depth.
* Many progress nodes now track progress in separate manned and unmanned tracks. This allows several contracts to appear at more relevant times.
* Base and Station, plant flag, kerbal recoveries (rescues), crewed surveys, tourism, and some World Firsts contracts now require manned progress.
* Satellite contracts now require unmanned progress.
* The algorithm to choose planets for all contracts is now more reliable. Max CB "distance" has been reduced to two. This means you will no longer see contracts for Duna and Eve right after taking off from Kerbin.

Science and Comms:
* Science Transmission messages now show strategy changes to science, funds, and reputation.
* All antennae now cut a transmission that has been interrupted due to power loss to prevent severely devaluing the resulting science.
* Added an option to antenna context menus to manually enable partial transmissions.
* Interrupted transmissions no longer delete science data. The data will attempt to return to the container it came from.
* Transmission from orbital surveyors and science labs was tweaked slightly to look and behave more like standard science transmissions.

NavBall:
* The navball is now available on EVA to assist in surveys.
* The EVA NavBall follows the orientation of the camera, rather than that of the Kerbal. This allows looking around to get your bearings.
* The navball throttle and RCS lights are hooked up to the EVA jetpack. 
* The IVA navball now functions with survey navigation.
* Survey navigation icon will now automatically target the next/closest adjacent waypoint in a survey upon completion of a targeted waypoint

Thermodynamics:
* Introduced the concept of 'Core Heat'. Allowing part systems to work much more expressively with temperatures, reducing unwanted cross-talk between temp effects on internal logic and heat transfer to other parts.
* Radiators should have a significant impact on core heat, allowing ISRU modules to operate at peak efficiency.
* Incredibly hot cores should bleed off some of their heat to the parent part, with the vessel very slowly getting warmer over time. 
* Parts should not explode from core overheating, but ISRU modules may shut down.
* Thermal efficiency should be consistent across all warp levels - no cheating!
* The mini-ISRU is balanced in that it cannot operate indefinitely. It will eventually shut down due to overheat and have to be allowed a cool-off period.
* The RTG is also part of this mechanic, making it a viable heater (Kerbals have the added advantage of not requiring any potatoes for unplanned long-duration stays on desolate planets).
* Fixed thermodynamics issues from 1.0.4 regarding unclamped conduction, shielded conduction, and other runaway cases.
* Reworked upper atmospheres of planets for better aerocapture experience. Added convection and shockwave temperature multipliers per body.
* EVA kerbals handled properly.
* Lowered max internal temperatures of crewed parts.
* Heating from engine exhaust rebalanced.
* Thermo at high warp is now no longer instantaneous, and is moddable via new interfaces.
* Unloaded vessels will have thermo applied for the unloaded time on reload.

Buoyancy and Water:
* Displacement is now calculated per part using dragcube information to estimate total actual volume of the part. 
* Bodies now have an ocean density: Kerbin/Laythe is 1 tonne/m^3, Eve is 1.5.
* The lowest and highest points of parts are calculated with respect to the water, and a submerged fraction of volume is calculated to modify buoyancy force.
* Impact speed (tested against crashTolerance) depends on impact angle, with a configurable minimum multiplier.
* Drag in water uses drag cubes and an accurate dynamic pressure calculation.
* Drag scales from high on first vessel contact down to a lower value after a few seconds.
* Drag also ramps back up when the vessel is below a minimum velocity (to model the highly turbulent flow when starting from a stop, and to make sure vessels do come to a stop).
* Lift behaves similarly, starting near zero for the madly turbulent flow of initial contact or first movement, up to a reasonable value.
* Various hollow parts have their displacement tuned to account for hollowness.
* Solar panels lose flow rate underwater, rocket engines lose Isp.
* Added underwater fog and tint, fixed camera issues underwater.

Physics:
* PhysicsGlobals now properly create the default values when Physics.cfg is removed. It includes many new values.
* Drag coefficient changes based on the same factors as turbulent convection (a Pseudo-Reynolds number). This means higher drag high up in the atmosphere, and slightly lower drag when going very fast very low.
* Asteroids have correct drag cubes now.

* Fixed issues with intake logic and display airspeed. Intakes can now have mach curves which can affect their efficiency at different mach numbers.
* IntakeAir is no longer displayed, since it was confusing, instead engines show whether their current requirements are being met.
* Engine modules support new curves for modify Isp based on air density and current mach number, so multFlow no longer exists as a toggle.
* Fixed an issue where throttle was not reset to zero on flameout.

* Fix an issue where VesselModule order could not be set, they now can override GetOrder, by which all VesselModules are sorted. 
* VesselModules default to order = 999 but FlightIntegrator has order 0 (this will allow easy setting of some modules to run before FlightIntegrator and some afterwards, 0 is a good delimeter).

=================================== v1.0.4 ============================================================

Bug Fixes:

* Hot-Fixed an issue where loading vessels equipped with heatshields from pre-1.0.3 saves would cause the game to crash.


=================================== v1.0.3 ============================================================

New:

Parts:
* Added five new Radiator parts, three of which are deployable.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Fix for horizontalSrfSpd being incorrectly calculated.
* Fixed unfortunate typo in the Docking Tutorial.
* Fixed an issue where moving the camera using a 3D mouse would break drag-and-dropping of parts in the editors.

Thermal:
* 1.0.3 features a revised thermal mechanic to better balance heating/cooling between pods and spaceplanes.
* Parts now have separate internal temperature and skin temperatures. 
* Skin temperature is the temperature used for radiation and convection, as well as engine exhaust damage. 
* Part internal temperature is increased by modules that generate heat and is used for part-part conduction. 
* Part internal and skin temperature also conduct between each other.
* Solar panel efficiency is now calculated based on skin temperature.
* When in an atmosphere, there is a divide between the exposed (to convection) and unexposed skin temperatures.
* When not in an atmosphere, only one skin temperature is tracked. the two temperatures are unified on atmosphere exit.
* Radiative outflux and influx is tracked separately for exposed and unexposed areas of skin (since the shock temperature is much higher than ambient temperature).

Physics:
* Added curve to control drag coefficient exponent to DCL and Physics.cs
* With lowered drag for sharply-tapered cubes, wing lift and wing drag lowered to match.
* Convection velocity exponent raised to 3.3 to increase reentry heat, as well as convection factor.
* Convection min area typo corrected.
* Newtonian convection kept pace with hypersonic convection.
* Drag curves modified to lower transonic hump.
* Wing curves modified to lower change in drag based on deflection.
* Calculation of exposed area for convection fixed, spaceplanes no longer get as extreme heat.
* Flight integrator: allow setting of newtonian density exponent (default 0.5) and use density or density^exponent whichever is greater.
* Broke radiation into two parts, you get the regular background temp on your face not exposed to reentry flux, and the very high reentry one for the area that is.
* Clamped convection correctly so you will never pass external temperature.
* Added a factor to simulate the switch from laminar to turbulent flow (in layman's terms, if you're going too fast too low, you get a massive boost to heating). That corrects so steep reentries are in fact deadlier than shallow ones.
* Added conduction-changer module to Mk1 and Mk1-2 pods (necessary to not kill chutes), buffed heat shields for new heat loads. Changed burn/rip numbers for drogue chutes.
* Parachute module updated to use the new convection code.
* Skin temperature variables are controllable on per-part basis.
* Sped up Flight Integrator slightly by minimizing repeated loops through parts.
* Better compute various vessel values This should lower phantom orbit changing and wobble!
* Remove thermal mass as a factor in conduction rate: what matters is area.
* Add conduction between parts' skins (as well as between the internals of parts, between a part's internals and its skin, and between the exposed and unexposed skin of a part, all of which were already in.)
* Fix some small issues in conduction (better clamping), sped it up slightly.
* Fixed issue with radiation (no longer have to use dirty hack to prevent parts blowing up).
* Lowered skin thickness slightly globally, made magic number sane (part.skinMassPerArea is now in kg/m^2).
* Added Hsp (resource thermal mass value) to Ore resource.

Parts:
* Updated Mk1 Inline Cockpit model.
* Further decrease in LV-N heat production.
* Rebalance of SRB for the new drag changes.
* KR-2L description updated, mass to 9t, SL Isp to 255.
* Jet thrusts rebalanced for new drag (thrusts lowered, BJE curves altered). Jet Isp halved due to increased fuel quantity and lower drag.
* Lowered LV-N heat a bit, still a bit hot.
* Edited KS-25x4 "Mammoth" engine description.
* Update description of radial-mount engines to recommend use for extra attitude control.
* Mk1 fuel tank: uses same dry mass fraction and resource filling compared to its LFO counterpart as Mk2 parts do.
* Radial attachment point cost lowered.
* Shielded docking port radial attach node fixed.
* Aerospike mass lowered as a buff (it needed a buff to compete with late-tier engines) and tangents fixed.
* Heat shield thermal mass modifier increased to 0.05 to deal with increased heating. Max temp lowered to 3000 to avoid totally overpowered radiation heatloss.
* Mk3 cargo bays have override cubes (they got missed when cargo bays got custom cubes) - should now have expected drag.
* New large landing gear have override cubes (cubes were reversed).
* Mk3 parts have breaking forces/torques specified and should no longer break on landing.
* Mk2 cockpits have same breaking force/torque as other Mk2 parts.
* Ablator resource heat capacity increased.
* Rebalanced LV-1 to have Sea Level ISP of 80.
* Rebalanced Poodle to have Sea Level ISP of 90.
* To fix spaceplane vs pod reentry and better allow hot reentries, temp is separated between part internal temperature and part skin temperature.
* Fixed some occlusion issues. Occlusion is now over-generous rather than under-generous.
* Buffed heat resistance of spaceplane parts.
* Added in CoL and CoP offsets for wing parts, no longer at the attach node.
* Fix for ablator and configs not taking skin temp into account.
* Fixed Radian vs Lat/Lon bug in Overlay and made displays more consistent.
* Fixed potential exploits with sci lab.
* Removed transparency and added direct-attach node to heat shields.
* Balanced heat shields for skin temps. A Mk1-2 straight-in reentry to Eve starting at 6.5km/sec surface (more orbital) is just barely survivable (ablator fully depletes), and regular Eve and Kerbin Munar reentries deplete about 1/6 to 1/4 the shield.
* Added a tuning factor to conduction between parts with different shielded states, so a cargo/service bay won't conduct much to parts within it. Since radiation is disabled for parts within bays, they'd just increase in temperature with no way to cool during reentry, and parts in bays would be the first to blow up on reentry.
* Upped non-drogue chute default full-deploy altitude since pods were crashing before the chute fully opened.
* Upped non-drogue chutes' stress/thermal limits for deployment (safe speed is now around 290m/s at sea level rather than 250). Increased the time to fully deploy slightly so less of a G shock.
* Increased max temp of linear RCS, slightly decreased max temp of RCS quad.
* Tweaks to fairings to change the skin:internal thermal mass distribution, and better protect parts inside fairings and cargo bays.
* Not-Rockomax Micronode side stack nodes corrected.
* Parachutes now have deployment warnings in the Part Action menu, when it's safe to deploy etc.
* Halved intakeAir requirements for jets. Slightly raises service ceiling, mainly helps mitigate flameouts due to resource transfer issues.
* Balanced thermal mass of drogue chutes to correct max opening velocities.
* Attach node refinements on Wing Connector Type A and Structural Wing Type A.
* Removed drag from Intake context UI.

Modding API:
* flow multiplier curves can multiply thrust rather than flow.
* Added method to convert string to ConfigNode.
* Un-hardcoded altitude for navball velocity indicator to change modes.

FX:
* Heat animations for engine nacelles and 1.25m intakes.
* SR-71 style exhaust flame for TurboRamjet.
* Nose and tail cones heat animation.
* Fixed incorrect transparency on the letter P on the UKSA flag.

====================================== v0.25.0 =========================================================

Highlights:

Destructible Facilties at KSC:

* Destroyed Facilities won't function until repaired, although most facilities can still operate with some degree of damage.
* Repairing broken facilities will cost you in Career Mode.
* Added a new Context Menu to Facilities at KSC which show extra info and to repair when necessary.

* Added a new music track to play in the background of the Admin Facility, called "Stratejazz".

Strategies:
* Managing your Career is greatly expanded with the addition of Strategies. Strategies let you take control over how your Space Program is managed, allowing you to tune it to best fit your own playing style.
* Space Program Department Reps: Meet Mortimer Kerman, your Finances guy, Linus Kerman, Science rep and Wernher's intern (because Wernher is too important to be bothered with these meetings) and Walt Kerman, PR representative who takes his job very literally sometimes, and Gus Kerman, head of Operations, who hopefully cleaned his boots before showing up this time.
* Strategies are of course, completely mod-friendly, and defined through cfg. So are the departments, in fact.

Crew Transfer:
* Kerbals in the same vessel don't need a spacesuit anymore to switch seats. Just click the crew hatch and select Transfer to tell them to go sit somewhere else.

Spaceplane Parts Overhaul:

* Rebuilt all stock vessels using the new parts.
* Obsolete spaceplane parts replaced by new ones when applicable. (Delta wing, Structural wind, Wing Connector, Mk2 fuselages)


KSC Vessel Markers:
* You can now see (and focus/recover) vessels landed near the Space Center directly from the Space Center scene. Markers will show their positions and expand to show extra information when clicked.

NavBall Vectors:

Editors:
* VAB and SPH scenes now show visible KSC facilities in their current states (as in destroyed). 
* Hold ModKey to override surface attachment in editors (when you want to stack to a node but can't because the part insists on sticking to the surface).


Crew Management:
* Automatic Crew Hiring is now disabled depending on difficulty setting.

Scenery:
* Tweaked the main terrain shader to use worldspace triplanar mapping on near detail textures. This means we now have enough texture accuracy to texture small rocks or even blades of grass. This is still an ongoing project though, not all Celestial Bodies use this new shader yet.

R&D:
* Entry Purchases in R&D are now required depending on difficulty mode.
* Added a 'Purchase All' button to purchase all parts after researching a node in R&D.

* Fixed several cases of UIs not stopping mouse clicks on objects behind themselves.
* Fixed a bug on OSX which made it impossible to open the Crew Hatch Dialog and possibly other dialogs too.
* Contracts App panel is now scalable in the VAB/SPH

========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.460+) HOTFIX ================================

* This build is a quick hotfix patch to address some issues that managed to slip by testing

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue with loading existing games, which would cause scenario modules (like R&D) to not load properly.
* Fixed an issue which caused Kerbals on EVA to become unresponsive after resuming a save.


========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.459) ====================================

The Asteroid Redirect Mission Patch is a special update in many ways. This time, we've partnered with NASA to produce a completely new set of features for the game.

Main Features:

* Asteroids:
Kerbin is no longer alone in its orbit. Nearby are countless objects that buzz in and out of its sphere of influence, some flying by harmlessly, others on impact trajectories. Ranging in size from just a few meters through 5 size classes up to gigantic objects weighing thousands of tons, these new objects should provide a new challenge for both new and veteran players. Each asteroid is procedurally generated, so no two are the same. Also, asteroids can have samples taken from them by EVAs, providing a constant source of valuable science data, right on the edge of Kerbin's SOI.

* Object Discovery and Tracking:
Before you set out after an asteroid, you first need to identify and track them using the Tracking and Discovery features on the Tracking Station Facility. Select one of the unknown objects spotted near Kerbin, and start tracking it actively to reveal more information about it. Also mind that untracked objects can be lost if they're left unobserved for too long.

* The Advanced Grabbing Unit (aka "The Claw")
As the name probably implies, this new part is the means by which asteroids can be captured to be redirected. Just arm the device, approach the target carefully, and the claw will do the rest. It's like a docking node, but without the need for a mate node on the other side. Better still, the AGU can be used to grab on to much more than just asteroids. In fact, it can pick up just about anything, even Kerbals.

* New SLS-inspired Size 3 parts:
 We've added a host of new parts, featuring the largest engines and fuel tanks ever seen in KSP. These new parts were designed based on NASA's upcoming Space Launch System, and they pack a huge amount of rocket power. Here they are:
 - Size 3 Liquid Fuel + Oxy Tanks, in Full, Half and Quarter-Sized Variants
 - 4x Size 3 Engine Cluster. The single most powerful piece of rocketry we've ever added to KSP.
 - Advanced Size 3 Single-Nozzle Engine, for when you need immense amounts of thrust in your upper stages
 - New Liquid Fuel Booster: A new way to boost your spacecraft, the LFB is a single part featuring twin engines, plus a very respectable amount of fuel. What more, you can even stack more liquid fuel tanks on top of it.
 - The Launch Escape System: Modelled after the Apollo LES, this new escape tower can save your crew should you underestimate the sheer power of your new rockets.

* Completely Overhauled Part Joints:
We have completely re-done the way parts attach to one another, to allow for much greater flexibility and control over each joint. Joints are also more accurate and stable, as both jointed sides are now anchored at the attachment node (this wasn't possible before the Unity 4.3 update).
 - Large parts also have a new system that allows them to attach much more rigidly to other parts, eliminating many cases where spamming struts was required.
 - Increased PhysX's global max angular velocity settings to improve joint stability.
 - Angular inertia values for parts now properly scale with mass. Some ships may feel heavier to fly now, but handling feels much more realistic overall. This also improves joint stability a lot.
 - Re-did the Strut Connector joints as well, to use the new joints system instead of their old ones. This dramatically improved their reliability and significantly reduced the number of ocurrences where ships spontaneously disassemble themselves on the launchpad.



New Features:

* Added new buttons to the Map Filtering panel to filter Unknown and SpaceObject type vessels.
* Focusing vessels on the Tracking Station will now display their patched conics trajectory.
* Added Time Warp controls to the Tracking Station and Space Center scenes.
* Added a button to the Time quadrant in the main flight UI to allow switching betwen Mission Time and Universal Time.
* Targeted vessels now display their trajectories as patched conics instead of single orbits.
* Maneuver Nodes are now persistent.
* Targeted Objects are now persistent.
* Added buttons to discard/accept maneuvers on the delta-v gauge by the navball.
* Added buttons to add/remove an orbit to the date of a maneuver node, allowing nodes to be planned for several orbits ahead.
* Maneuver handles can now be fine-tweaked with the mousewheel when hovering over them.
* RCS and XenonGas containers on earlier stages are now drained before containers on later stages.
* Celestial Bodies now show a 'Focus View' button on their context menus in Map View.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Celestial bodies you have an encounter patch with will display that patch in local mode when they are focused on the Map View or Tracking Station.
* Switching between Linear and Rotation controls in Docking UI mode no longer toggles SAS.
* Fixed a bug where patched conics on extremely eccentric orbits could break the simulation at very high warp speeds.
* Fixed incorrect rendering of ascending and descending nodes when targeting a non-closed orbit.
* Fixed a bug where targeting an object on a hyperbolic orbit wouldn't display rendezvous information on the map.
* Tweaked the thrust and Isp values of Ion Engines and the two tiny rocket engines. All were severely underpowered to be of any practical use.
* Quicksaving is now allowed at all times. In unstable situations, an autosave won't be created at the same time.  
* Greatly improved the accuracy of the physics->rails transition, eliminating drift on nearby vessels when warping during a rendezvous situation, especially high-velocity ones.
* The Map Filtering buttons now toggle independently on left click, and toggle single/all on right click.
* Fixed several cases where Kerbals on EVA would glitch out in very painful ways, mostly when the game changed reference frames while they were in ragdoll state.
* Intersection nodes between orbits no longer 'skip' the closest intersection when placing a maneuver node near the player's position.

==================================== v0.23.0 =========================================================

New:

* The Science Archives:
- Browse through all the science you've done in your Career games in this new section of the R&D Facility. 

* Tweakables:
- Several parts can now be tweaked individually by right-clicking them during construction. 
- Landing Gear can be set to start out deployed or retracted, and can also be made steerable.
- Engines can have a thrust limiter set on them, so you can balance out asymmetrical thruster configurations (or use differential thrust for taxiing).
- Wheels can be tweaked to have their engines toggled, steering locked, all before launch (and after, of course).
- Control Surfaces can be tweaked to toggle response to pitch, roll and yaw input individually. 

* Science Revisited:
- Transmitting scientific data no longer allows you to max out the value of a subject just by repeating the transmission multiple time.
- Removing the experiment data from some experiment modules (for transmission or by EVA) will render them inoperable.
- Resetting an experiment can still be done freely as long as the data is not removed from the module.

* Solar System:
- Added a new Biome Map for Minmus.
- Cleaned up the Biome Maps for Kerbin and the Mun, to remove areas where Biomes would be detected incorrectly.

* The Lab Module:
- Added a new part called a Laboratory Module, which allows experiment data and samples to be processed before transmission, increasing their science value.
- The Lab Module requires 2 crews inside to operate and a whole lot of power as well. 
- Added a new button to the experiment review dialog to process collected data on the Lab if one is available (and operational) on your vessel.

* EVA Data Transport:
- Kerbals on EVA can now collect the data from experiment modules and store them on crew-carrying modules.
- Kerbals can also collect data from other data container modules, including other Kerbals.
- EVAs can also store samples collected from other experiments on the Lab. 

* Part Tooltips Overhaul:
- The tooltips that pop up when mousing over a part on the editors have been completely redesigned.
- The tooltips show essential info only at first, but can be expanded to show more info with RMB.
- Once expanded, you can right-click again to collapse, or to pin other tooltips if you hover over other parts.
- Re-organized the part information to group stats for each module and resource container on a part.
- Added a larger icon for the part on the tooltip itself, featuring a scale to give an idea of size before picking. 

* All-around Optimizations:
- We've gone over all our code to make sure it runs as efficiently as possible.
- Upgraded to Unity version 4.2.2 to make full use of its own bugfixes and tweaks.
- Texture loading has been sped up, loading times are noticeably reduced.

* [Windows-Only] 6-DOF Device Support:
- 6-DOF input devices such as the Space Navigator are now supported both as camera and flight controllers.
- Scroll Lock will toggle the device mode in flight.
- Due to driver limitations this is a Windows-only feature for now. We're ready to implement support in OSX and Linux as soon as those drivers become available.


Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Parts:
- The logic for all-vessel resource flow (such as Electric Charge and MonoPropellant) has been re-done. 
- Fixed those resource containers not being able to drain fully or store an amount larger than their current available space.

* Docking:
- Fixed an issue that caused docking ports to resume their states incorrectly after docking, making it impossible to undock afterwards.
- Fixed a big issue with docking operations through physicsless parts in the hierarchy between the port and the original vessel root.

* EVAs:
- EVAs now use actual MonoPropellant for their jetpacks, instead of their own fuel. 
- Fixed an issue with collision resolution that caused EVAs to sometimes fall over and become uncontrollable.
- Kerbals other than you will now pick themselves up from ragdoll state if they are involved in any 'accidents' or are flat out being used as Kerbowling pins.
- Parts that land onto splashed-down parts are now considered to be landed. This allows EVAs to walk on floating platforms.

* Other Fixes:
- The Return key will no longer reset the staging sequence in the Editors, or return you to the Main Menu at KSC.
- The Main Menu now remembers the 'page' you were at when you left it, so if you return from a loaded game, you'll find it still at the "Start Game" screen.
- Fixed several issues with joystick axis mapping and indexing.
- Updated the Input settings screen to expose a few new control options that weren't accessible before.
- Fixed an issue that could lead to loss of GUI responsiveness after leaving flight during reentry or supersonic flight.

* Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash when starting an EVA.
* Kerbals on ladders no longer get teleported when packed (they just let go).
* Retracting a ladder with a Kerbal on it while in orbit will no longer cause them to go on random trajectories.
* Fixed an issue where older parts that still used direct DAE or OBJ model loading wouldn't have their collision meshes rescaled.
* Fixed a problem with EVAs saving the fuel value, which sometimes caused a conflict that could lead to a game crash.
* Fixed an issue where the crew list on the hatch dialog wouldn't scroll.

==================================== v0.16.0 x2 ===================================================

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
* Kerbals now fall off ladders if they become disabled or are destroyed (can happen with retractable ones)
* Added key and axis bindings for EVA controls. Reorganized the Input Settings screen a little.
* Added separate control bindings for walking and jetpacking on EVAs.
* Added 1:1 EVA rotation axes. Using them disables the automatic orientation system.
* Tweaked the automatic orientation system to eliminate gimbal-lock situations, and flipped the X mouse axis input.
* The NavBall and Staging Quadrant are no longer visible during EVA.
* Fixed issues with saving/resuming EVAs while ragdolling.
* Fixed RCS and SAS toggling on other vessels.
* Fixed an issue that caused Kerbals to tumble in space forever.
* Fixed command pod airlock node positioning, could cause violent crew ejections sometimes.
* Fixed an issue with Kerbals crashing into things that could cause a stream of errors and a complete game crash.
* Vessels take collision impact momentum into account whenever possible 
* FlightInputHandler now stops running while on EVA.
* Fixed a problem where vessels would be stuck as 'Landed' if boarding a part while in contact with another.
* Fixed issues with the large Landing Leg colliders.

* It is now possible to deploy/retract ladders from outside the ship, provided you're close enough to it. (while on EVA).

==================================== v0.16.0 x1 ===================================================

New: 
* Kerbal crewmembers in Extra-Vehicular Activities, both at the surface and in orbit.
* Kerbal scientists, mechanics and ground crew all around the Space Center Facilities.
* New Internal Cockpit models, with full modding support.
* New (Much lighter on performance) Particle Effects and Explosions
* Several new, larger rocket parts.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
* Set all parts on the same vessel to ignore collisions with each other. 
  Hopefully this will solve all part-to-part collision problems.

* Reduced the minimum collider intersection threshold to much less than before. 
  Should increase collision accuracy and hopefully solve issues like landing gear
  going through the ground. (all thanks to above fix)

* [API Change] MemoryStream wrappers that were mistakenly not committed for 1.15.1 have been added to the code.

* Packing/Unpacking ships is now done without affecting the ship's scene hierarchy.
  Now, vessels take care of keeping their own parts in place while packed, making for much more stable
  physics behavior when going in and out of time warp.

* Improved vessel/part loading from persistence procedure, for more stable and accurate flight resuming.

* Fixed a bug in the Tracking Station scene, which prevented scrolling the vessel list.

* The Vessel Switching keys now only cycle between nearby vessels and won't cause the scene to reload anymore.
  To switch to far-away vessels, you must use the map view.

* (Possibly) increased performance on the flight scenes (from the terrain tweak also)
* Found and fixed the true cause of the orbit NaN bug. 
* Corrected the aileron action on ControlSurface parts. Now aileron input is determined based on part orientation instead of symmetry counterparts.

==================================== v0.14.1 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Found and fixed the real cause of the staging issues that have plagued every release from 13.2 onward.
* The debug console is no longer spammed with NaN errors. This could cause extreme lag in densely populated game worlds.
* Fixed an issue where unloaded vessels would not update their orbits, causing them to resume incorrectly if they switched SOIs.
* Fixed the save folder paths on the Mac version (they were ending up inside the app package)
* It is now possible to do a Quickload (F9) after a crash (with the flight end screen up).
* The game will no longer overwrite the quicksave when resuming flights. Only when creating new ones.

==================================== v0.14.0x6 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed yet another staging issue.
* Fixed an issue with the object scaling for Bill, Bob and Jeb, which made them not sit right in the cockpit and their screen messages to not appear.
* Fixed a game flow issue in which it was possible to cancel the flight end screen, leading to an error and leaving the game stuck in the flight scene.
* Fixed an issue which might have caused repeated Kerbals to be generated. 
* Fixed the End Flight screen lockup issue after KIA.
* Fixed the problem with landed vessels being lobbed into the air after resuming a saved flight.
* Fixed the small fuel tank visual gap when connected to the mk1 pod directly.
* Fixed the tracking station rotation and texturing issues.




==================================== v0.14.0x5 ======================================================
New:

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue that caused parts to be detected as landed when in collision with parts from other vessels, even while flying.
* Fixed an issue where the persistence system would not clean out parts that were landed on other parts, rather than on the launchpad or KSC area.
* Unloaded orbiting vessels will continue orbiting into the ground, if there is no atmosphere to reentry-burn them.
* The 'isPersistent' part cfg parameter, ironically enough, wasn't persistent itself.
* Removed an 'experimental' tweak done on the terrain shader that caused the Mun to look very bright in bright areas, and very dark in dark ones.
* Added an icon image for Landing Legs.
* Fixed the buttons of the pod selection window not responding to clicks when the VAB tutorial was active.
* Fixed the VAB tutorial never being shown after the first time, even when activated in the settings.
* Fixed the tutorial window disappearing behind the command pod selection window.
* Changed the ground detection system to a far more stable hold-and-release method.
* Added an icon for the landing legs (and made it update its colours)
* Tweaked the landing leg collision mesh to avoid phantom forces from poorly-solved collisions
* Updated the description for landing legs (missing description for the other parts)



==================================== v0.14.0x4 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with Jeb's confidence levels (he lost his nerve on x3).
* Fixed a few issues with the atmospheric pressure and temperature curves from x3.
* Fixed another problem with staging that was made apparent in x3. It caused the ship to 'skip' stages.


==================================== v0.14.0x3 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the vessel label icons, which were invisible.
* Increased the ejection force of Decouplers and Radial Decouplers (too underpowered after the physics fix).
* Removed the landingleg.max file that snuck itself into the distribution.
* Fixed the Camera Mode text not being displayed in flight.
* Fixed the map focus switching (Tab not working).
* Fixed Fuel tanks apparently not resuming fuel levels properly (was an icon issue).
* Fixed Landing legs not resuming their states properly.
* If a landed vessel decoupled from its base while taking off, the vessel would still be flagged as being landed.
* Sometimes, landed vessels would spawn a few feet off the ground and stay locked in place forever.
* SAS and ASAS modules on other vessels were getting activated along with the current focused vessel.
* Reloaded parts were not storing references to their symmetry counterparts properly. That caused all sorts of weird behaviour.
* Fixed an issue that caused vessels to be placed in the wrong positions occasionally (most noticeable in the tracking station).
* Fixed an issue that caused incorrect staging when loading ships in the flight scene.

==================================== v0.14.0x2 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* The KSC buildings had lost their tags which identified them as eligible for landed debris clean up. Fixed now.
* Fixed the flight scene time step being incorrectly initialized as 0.04ms (would cause wobbly physics).
* Fixed a problem with the Plugins folder in the Mac version, which caused the game to halt when loading.
* Removed a save file that sneaked its way into the distribution.

==================================== v0.14.0x1 ======================================================

* Support for multiple simultaneous flights and switching from ship to ship.
* The Tracking Station Facility at the Space Center, allows you to select and resume a flight in progress.
* Holding the middle mouse button will allow you to rotate the flight camera about itself, instead of rotating its pivot. (double-clicking the MMB will recenter it)
* Tweaked the orbit rendering on the Map View to reduce clutter when several icons are moused over at the same time.
* Landed or Splashed vessels now display their coordinates (or location, if available) when moused over on the Map View.
* More Crew Members so you can launch missions while others are underway.
* An External Module Loader, which enables mod makers to program their own part modules.

Bug Fixes:
* The flight camera is no longer able to go upside down.
* The ORBITAL camera mode will no longer change orientations when switching spheres of influence.
* Fixed an issue with .craft file saving and loading, which makes it possible to save ship titles independently of the file name.
* Un-warping a landed ship will no longer cause an unphysical jerk on it, which could possibly destroy it.
* Landed/Splashed vessels no longer show an Apoapsis icon on the Map View.
* The Map Camera now responds to the keyboard bindings for camera zoom.
* Decouplers now obey the second law of physics (Acceleration = Force/Mass)
* Decouplers now obey the third law of physics (every action has an equal and opposite reaction).
* RCS Fuel Tanks now drain symmetrically if placed using symmetry.


==================================== v0.13.3 (Demo)===================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB. 
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.
* Fixed a bug that caused symmetrical parts to lose the reference to one of their counterparts, leading to incorrect symmetrical placements. 
* Reverted the Staging logic to the 13.1 system, as the changes made in 13.2 were buggy. 


==================================== v0.13.2 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB.
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.

==================================== v0.13.1 ======================================================

* Official Release

Bug Fixes:
* Removed parent-wise fuel crossfeed from Radial Decouplers. Fuel Lines made that obsolete.
* Fixed an issue that prevented attachment nodes from affecting connected part rotations properly.
* Fixed an issue with the part loader, which would crash if a binary mesh was found, but no .dae or .obj file was present.


==================================== v0.13.1x1 ====================================================

New:
* Recompiled on the latest version of the Unity engine, to add multithreaded rendering support and better memory management.
* Changed the Fuel Line flow direction, so fuel will flow from the first-placed end of the line to the second end.
* Holding Ctrl and clicking on a part on the ship at the VAB will now automatically flip the parts list to the selected part's page.
* Added in-game credits

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the custom part sounds loading system, which wasn't working on the last release.
* The part loader will no longer freeze if it cannot find a part module to load. It will load the base Part module, and make it visible but unavailable on the VAB.


==================================== v0.13.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.13.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Increased the heat conductivity and heat dissipation values for all parts, to compensate for the new heat exchange system.
* Fixed the time quadrant on the UI being unresponsive to mouse clicks if there were part icons behind it.
* Fixed the staging quadrant being partially visible in the map view.
* Fixed a problem that made it possible to delete the command pod in the VAB by using Ctrl+Z.


==================================== v0.13.0x3 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Tweaked the part heat exchange model, for a considerable fps boost with very large ships

New:
* Added a new icon for the Fuel Line parts.
* Changed the icon grouping rule on RCS Blocks and Strut Connectors to group to all parts of the same type on it's stage.


==================================== v0.13.0x2 ====================================================

New:
* Pressing F2 will hide the UI completely (so you can take UI-free screenshots).

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the weird 'glass-like' artifacts in game during launch
* Fixed the parts not receiving mouse events on the VAB. This also affected collision detection on the VAB.
* Fixed the in-flight settings screen being drawn under the main UI.
* Tweaked the fuel tank surface attachment point. It was a little too close to the collider, and sometimes caused false collisions.
* Fixed a bug with the parts code that allowed them to bypass receiving gravity and drag forces if it's hierarchy root was destroyed.
* Fixed the map camera code so that it will remember where it was if you re-open it. (this tweak was left out of the X1 build apparently)
* Fixed the part icon numbers (when multiple icons are grouped) not being positioned correctly on a few resolutions.



==================================== v0.13.0x1 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Removed a lot of needless halts on the part processing routine during loading.
* Restructured the sound loading system so the main loading thread doesn't wait for it to finish before moving on.
* Deferred adding of several part components so they're only added when they're needed.
* Mesh tangents can now be loaded from file, instead of being recalculated every time.
* The mesh loader now ignores materials from file, because they were going to be replaced anyway later.
* Meshes are now saved to binary files (serialized) when loaded for the first time, and loaded from those files when they're available.
* Changed the rendering method for the part icons on the staging sequence. This can prevent thousands of objects from being created when flying large ships.
* Ship parts now have adjustable levels of physics, so small parts are not as deeply simulated as large ones. This reduces the amount of physics objects and joints to simulate.
* Reduced the amount of code components attached to each part, making for less calls on each frame.


New:
* The part loader will check if the saved optimized meshes are out-of-date, and update them when necessary.
* A new Fuel Line part, that allows fuel to be drained off external (side-mounted) tanks.
* It is now possible to warp time freely when the ship is landed.
* Added a progress bar for the loading screen.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the mission timer not getting started if the first stage was moved before launching.
* Liquid Fuel now flows from the "top" attachment node, instead of from the parent part (unless there is no top node, in which case it flows from the parent part).
* Parts now keep the references to the part attached in each attachment node. (makes top-node based fuel flow possible)
* Fixed a bug which prevented the ship selection dialogs from receiving double-click events. Now it is possible to select a ship file by double clicking on it.
* Improved rendering of hyperbolic (escape) orbits in the map view. The trajectory is now a constant size regardless of eccentricity, and isn't warped by the splines.
* The Map camera will now remember it's last position, and return to it when the map is reopened.

NOTES: 
* The new part loading system will generate optimized meshes for all parts whenever it finds new part models. This means the first time you run the game, it might take longer for loading to complete.

* This update introduces some new features that make ships built on previous versions incompatible. If a ship fails to load, it's because it isn't compatible with this version. We apologize for the inconvenience.

==================================== v0.12.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.12.0x5 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Removed the SAS disabling itself when going into Map View or into high warp rates.
* Implemented a new Kepler Equation solver for extremely high eccentricity orbits, the old one was becoming unstable and freezing the game.

==================================== v0.12.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with the Floating Origin system which caused the ship to jitter on very high warp rates and speeds. (aka The Warp Shakes)
* Fixed another problem which could cause the game to crash if entering/leaving another planet's SOI while on 1x or 2x warp.
* (Hopefully) fixed a problem with 0 inclination orbits that could cause them to become reversed or rotated when transitioning between planets/moons.


==================================== v0.12.0x3 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem that caused ships to reverse direction when unwarping while on a hyperbolic orbit.
* Fixed a few typos in some part descriptions.

Bug Fixes:
* The game would crash if the VAB tutorial is advanced too far while keeping the command module selection window open.
* Engine gimbals were not deflecting as much as they should be.
* Fixed the Max G reading on the flight end screen. Now it will only log sustained G forces.
* Fixed the Surface/Orbital Speed reading getting messed up when restarting a flight.
* Fixed a problem with the Time Warp code, that would sometimes force the time rate to 2x, but not unpack the ship. It would also cause G forces and other values to be incorrectly calculated.
* Fixed a problem with unpacking the ship for physics that could cause centers of mass to be offset, leading to uncontrollable tumbling.
* Fixed a problem that could cause orbits to become reversed when entering/leaving another planet's sphere of influence.
* Changed the Time Warp altitude restrictions to be proportional to the current planet or moon's radius.


==================================== v0.12.0x1 ====================================================

New:
* A Moon

Bug Fixes:
* Improved the way velocities are applied when resuming physics.
* Fixed the Advanced SAS icon showing as a question mark on the VAB.
* Fixed a bug where cloning parts by removing and undoing would cause them to receive duplicate IDs (and crash the game when loading the ship again).
* Tidied up the flight statistics numbers formatting a bit, so they're easier to make sense of.
* Time Warp will now smoothly increase/decrease towards the set time rate, for a much more fluid transition.
* Made several improvements to the Map View orbit rendering.
* Fixed the rails->physics transition, so that there is no significant change anymore in orbital parameters when going out of warp.
* Made some significant improvements to the physical joints that hold the ship together. Ships will not wobble anymore when going back into 1x time after warping, and the joints themselves are more stable overall.
* Made a small tweak to the part tooltips on the VAB, to prevent them from going off-screen on small resolutions. (was noticeable with the new command pod selection dialog)


==================================== v0.11.1 ====================================================

* Fixed the highest altitude reading on the flight results screen. It was overflowing on really large numbers.


==================================== v0.11.0x4 ==================================================

New:

* Changed most flight calculations to use double-precision

BugFixes:

* High-speed wind sound was audible for no apparent reason on map view
* Time warp dropped to 4x even though there were higher possible options available (when altitude goes below the lower limit for a time rate)
* Orbital time was running much faster than it should at 2x and 4x warp.
* Fixed the Kepler Equation solver in the orbit system, which was causing a number of problems when going into and out of high warp rates.
* Going into warp above 4x now is only possible if no forces are being applied on the ship
* Improved formatting on orbital node display numbers, to make it easier to tell  the difference between 10,000m and 100,000m

==================================== v0.11.0x1 ==================================================

New:
* Overhauled Space Center terrain area in both flight and space center scenes.

* The MET display will now start counting on liftoff instead of on flight start.
* Tuned the terrain system a bit, to improve visual quality at high altitudes.
* Greatly improved the input lock system. Now, components that lock game controls won't override locks placed by other components.
* Improved the flight camera code. On Chase mode the camera will not spin around at the poles anymore, and both modes are more stable overall.
* Optimized the terrain system rendering, and got a nice boost in performance during flight.


==================================== v0.10.1 ==================================================
Bug Fixes:
* Eliminated the sharp atmospheric cutoff at 34,500m. Now there is atmosphere up to around 68,000m.
