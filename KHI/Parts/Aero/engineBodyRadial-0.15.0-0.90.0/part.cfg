description = This engine body features radially situated air intake flaps and a decently sized fuel container. This unit provides both fuel and air flow for air-breathing engines, making it a convenient solution for aircraft design. C7 representatives insist that this unit has always looked like this, and that it is a totally new design, most definitely not a radiator cowl turned backwards.
