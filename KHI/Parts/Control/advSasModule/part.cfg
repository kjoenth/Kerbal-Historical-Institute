description = After seeing many Kerbonauts struggle to keep a ship under control, KSP decided they needed to make something to help Kerbonauts fly. One toy store visit later and fifty toy gyroscopes heavier, KSP created the "Fly For Me Module" (F.F.M. for short). Who would of thought a metal barrel filled with toy gyroscopes could help steer a ship!
