description = The Anti-Spin Module started out as a mobile water cooler in the Astronaut Complex. It had a tendency to fall over when being moved, and was handed over to a pair of research students to determine why. Extensive testing showed that movement of the water would exert a force on the inside of the container. The students discovered a method by which this could be used to help steer a small rocket, and immediately patented their design. One went on to become famous rocket scientist Wernher von Kerman. The other went on to found the Dawton Kerman Aboveground Pool Company.
