//description = The CF series A110 fuel tank. It's just like the A130 and A132, but smaller. A little fuel tank? Preposterous!
description = The T250 tank had some difficulty being accepted in the spacecraft engineering world, because most rocket builders had trouble overcoming their urges to squee at the "cute little fuel tank." This initial reaction was only put aside when the amount of fiery explosions in assembly areas became so high, strict guidelines were put in place to prohibit "teasing the fuel containers." The T250 Tank now is widely used in several space programs, especially in conjunction with the LV-909 engine.
