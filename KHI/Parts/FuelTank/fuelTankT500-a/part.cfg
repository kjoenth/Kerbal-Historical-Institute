//description = The CF series A130 fuel tank. It's just like the A132 fuel tank, but looks different. Hooray options!
description = The FL series was received as a substantial upgrade over previous fuel containers used in the Space Program, generally due to it's ability to keep the fuel unexploded more often than not. Fuel tanks are useless if there isn't a Liquid Engine attached under it. They can also be stacked with other fuel tanks to increase the amount of fuel for the engine below.
