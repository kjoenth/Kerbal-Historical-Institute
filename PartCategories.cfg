STRATEGY
{
  name = AntiqueRadios
  title = Antique Radio Fitting
  desc = Recovering parts landed far away from the Space Center can be very costly, but I reckon we can reduce those costs by installing antique radios in the parts we launch. These radios are easily obtainable from the local junkyard, but are expensive to maintain. Even so, they should make it much easier to find parts, even if they're on the other side of Kerbin. What do you say?
